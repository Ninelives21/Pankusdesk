							To solve this problem, we need to consider the energy of the

						<p>
							1. <b>Potential Energy (U)</b>: The potential energy of the

						<p>
							\[ U = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{r} \]
						</p>
						<p>

							\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} = 9 \times 10^9 \) N m²/C² (Coulomb
							constant)
						</p>
						<p>Plugging in the values, we get:</p>

							\[ U = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{2 \times 29 \times (1.6 \times

						</p>
						<p>
							2. <b>Kinetic Energy (K)</b>: The kinetic energy of the
							\(\alpha\)-particle is given by:
						</p>
						<p>\[ K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \]</p>
						<p>
							For the \(\alpha\)-particle to arrive at a distance \(10^{-12}\) m

							the potential energy at that distance (assuming the initial
							potential energy is zero).
						</p>
						<p>Setting \( K = U \), we have:</p>
						<p>\[ \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = U \]</p>
						<p>\[ v^2 = \frac{2U}{m} \]</p>
						<p>3. <b>Calculation</b>:</p>
						<p>First, we calculate the potential energy:</p>
						<p>
							\[ U = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{2 \times 29 \times (1.6 \times

						</p>
						<p>
							\[ U = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{2 \times 29 \times 2.56 \times
							10^{-38}}{10^{-12}} \]
						</p>
						<p>
							\[ U = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{2 \times 29 \times 2.56 \times
							10^{-26}}{1} \]
						</p>
						<p>\[ U = 9 \times 10^9 \times 148.48 \times 10^{-26} \]</p>
						<p>\[ U = 9 \times 10^9 \times 1.4848 \times 10^{-24} \]</p>
						<p>\[ U = 13.3632 \times 10^{-15} \]</p>
						<p>\[ U = 1.33632 \times 10^{-14} \text{ J} \]</p>
						<p>Finally, using the kinetic energy equation:</p>
						<p>\[ v^2 = \frac{2U}{m} \]</p>
						<p>
							The mass of an \(\alpha\)-particle (\(m\)) is approximately \(6.64
							\times 10^{-27}\) kg.
						</p>
						<p>
							\[ v^2 = \frac{2 \times 1.33632 \times 10^{-14}}{6.64 \times
							10^{-27}} \]
						</p>
						<p>
							\[ v^2 = \frac{2.67264 \times 10^{-14}}{6.64 \times 10^{-27}} \]
						</p>
						<p>\[ v^2 = 4.024 \times 10^{12} \]</p>
						<p>\[ v = \sqrt{4.024 \times 10^{12}} \]</p>
						<p>\[ v \approx 2 \times 10^6 \text{ m/s} \]</p>
						<p>
							Therefore, the correct answer is (b) \(2 \times 10^6 \text{
							m/s}\).
