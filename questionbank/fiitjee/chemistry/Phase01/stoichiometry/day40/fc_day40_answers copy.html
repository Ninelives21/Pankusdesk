					<h4>Answer for Question 9</h4>
					<p>
						To prepare a solution that is 0.2 M NaCl, starting with 100 mL of
						0.1 M NaCl solution, the correct options are:
					</p>
					<p>1. Calculate the initial moles of NaCl:</p>
					<p>
						- Molarity (M) = 0.1 M<br />
						- Volume (V) = 100 mL = 0.1 L<br />
						- Moles of NaCl = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 M × 0.1 L = 0.01 moles
					</p>
					<p>2. Determine the final volume needed for 0.2 M solution:</p>
					<p>
						- Desired Molarity (M) = 0.2 M<br />
						- Initial moles of NaCl = 0.01 moles<br />
						- Final Volume = Initial Moles of NaCl / Desired Molarity = 0.01
						moles / 0.2 M = 0.05 L = 50 mL<br />
						Therefore, to make the solution 0.2 M, the final volume needs to be
						50 mL. Since the initial volume is 100 mL, 50 mL of water should be
						evaporated.
					</p>
					<p>3. Calculate the additional moles of NaCl needed:</p>
					<p>
						- Desired Molarity (M) = 0.2 M<br />
						- Initial Volume (V) = 0.1 L<br />
						- Desired Moles of NaCl for 0.2 M = 0.2 M × 0.1 L = 0.02 moles<br />
						- Additional moles of NaCl needed = 0.02 moles - 0.01 moles = 0.01
						moles
					</p>
					<p>4. Convert moles of NaCl to grams:</p>
					<p>
						- Molar mass of NaCl = 58.5 g/mol<br />
						- Mass of NaCl = Moles × Molar mass = 0.01 moles × 58.5 g/mol =
						0.585 g
					</p>
					<p>5. Verify the given options:</p>
					<p>
						- (A) add 0.585 g NaCl: Correct<br />
						- (B) add 1.17 g NaCl: Incorrect<br />
						- (C) add 0.019 mol NaCl: Incorrect<br />
						- (D) evaporate 50 mL of water: Correct
					</p>
					<p>Therefore, the correct options are (A) and (D).</p>

					<h4>Answer for Question 10</h4>
					<p>
						The reaction 2C + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2CO is carried out by taking
						24 g of carbon and 96 g of O<sub>2</sub>. To determine which of the
						given options are correct, follow these steps:
					</p>
					<p>1. Write the balanced chemical equation:</p>
					<p>2C + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2CO</p>
					<p>2. Calculate the moles of reactants:</p>
					<p>
						- Molar mass of carbon (C) = 12 g/mol<br />
						- Molar mass of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) = 32 g/mol<br />
						- Moles of carbon (C) = 24 g / 12 g/mol = 2 moles<br />
						- Moles of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) = 96 g / 32 g/mol = 3 moles
					</p>
					<p>3. Determine the limiting reactant:</p>
					<p>
						- According to the balanced equation, 2 moles of carbon react with 1
						mole of O<sub>2</sub>.<br />
						- Therefore, 2 moles of carbon would require 1 mole of
						O<sub>2</sub>.<br />
						- Given 3 moles of O<sub>2</sub>, oxygen is in excess.
					</p>
					<p>4. Calculate the amount of CO formed:</p>
					<p>
						- Since 2 moles of carbon produce 2 moles of CO:<br />
						- Moles of CO formed = 2 moles<br />
						- Molar mass of CO = 28 g/mol<br />
						- Mass of CO formed = 2 moles × 28 g/mol = 56 g
					</p>
					<p>5. Calculate the amount of O<sub>2</sub> left:</p>
					<p>
						- 1 mole of O<sub>2</sub> is needed for the reaction:<br />
						- Moles of O<sub>2</sub> left = 3 moles - 1 mole = 2 moles
					</p>
					<p>
						6. Calculate the amount of carbon needed to use O<sub>2</sub>
						completely:
					</p>
					<p>
						- To use 3 moles of O<sub>2</sub> completely:<br />
						- Moles of C required = 6 moles<br />
						- Mass of C required = 6 moles × 12 g/mol = 72 g
					</p>
					<p>Therefore, the correct options are:</p>
					<p>
						- (A) O<sub>2</sub> is left in excess<br />
						- (B) 56 g of CO is formed<br />
						- (C) 2 moles of O<sub>2</sub> is left<br />
						- (D) To use O<sub>2</sub> completely, 72 g carbon is needed
					</p>
					<p>Ans = A, B, C, D</p>

					<h4>Answer for Question 11</h4>
					<p>
						The amount of chlorine produced from 34.8 g of MnO<sub>2</sub> is
						sufficient to react with:
					</p>
					<p>1. Write the balanced chemical equations:</p>
					<p>
						MnO<sub>2</sub> + 4HCl &rarr; MnCl<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> +
						2H<sub>2</sub>O<br />
						6NaOH + 3Cl<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 5NaCl + NaClO<sub>3</sub> +
						3H<sub>2</sub>O
					</p>
					<p>2. Calculate the moles of MnO<sub>2</sub>:</p>
					<p>
						- Molar mass of MnO<sub>2</sub> = 87 g/mol<br />
						- Moles of MnO<sub>2</sub> = 34.8 g / 87 g/mol = 0.4 moles
					</p>
					<p>3. Determine the moles of Cl<sub>2</sub> produced:</p>
					<p>
						- According to the balanced equation, 1 mole of MnO<sub>2</sub>
						produces 1 mole of Cl<sub>2</sub><br />
						- Moles of Cl<sub>2</sub> produced = 0.4 moles
					</p>
					<p>
						4. Determine the moles of NaOH that can react with Cl<sub>2</sub>:
					</p>
					<p>
						- According to the second balanced equation, 3 moles of Cl<sub
							>2</sub
						>
						react with 6 moles of NaOH<br />
						- 1 mole of Cl<sub>2</sub> reacts with 2 moles of NaOH<br />
						- Moles of NaOH = 0.4 moles of Cl<sub>2</sub> × 2 = 0.8 moles of
						NaOH
					</p>
					<p>Ans = B</p>

					<h4>Answer for Question 12</h4>
					<p>
						NaCl produced (by taking Cl<sub>2</sub> and NaOH as calculated
						above) when present in a solution of 200 mL corresponds to a
						molarity of:
					</p>
					<p>1. Recap from previous calculation:</p>
					<p>
						- The amount of chlorine produced from 34.8 g of MnO<sub>2</sub> was
						sufficient to react with 0.8 moles of NaOH.<br />
						- From the balanced equation:<br />
						6NaOH + 3Cl<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 5NaCl + NaClO<sub>3</sub> +
						3H<sub>2</sub>O<br />
						- 3 moles of Cl<sub>2</sub> react with 6 moles of NaOH to produce 5
						moles of NaCl.<br />
						- 0.8 moles of NaOH react with 0.4 moles of Cl<sub>2</sub> (from the
						previous calculation).
					</p>
					<p>2. Calculate the moles of NaCl produced:</p>
					<p>
						- According to the stoichiometric ratio:<br />
						5 moles of NaCl / 6 moles of NaOH = x moles of NaCl / 0.8 moles of
						NaOH<br />
						x = (5 × 0.8) / 6 = 0.6667 moles of NaCl
					</p>
					<p>3. Determine the molarity of NaCl in 200 mL solution:</p>
					<p>
						- Volume of solution = 200 mL = 0.2 L<br />
						- Molarity (M) is defined as moles of solute per liter of
						solution:<br />
						Molarity of NaCl = Moles of NaCl / Volume of solution in L = 0.6667
						moles / 0.2 L = 3.3335 M
					</p>
					<p>Therefore, the correct option is (D) none.</p>
