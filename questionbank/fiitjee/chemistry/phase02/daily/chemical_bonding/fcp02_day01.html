							Ionic Mobility: In an aqueous solution, ionic mobility depends on
							the size of the hydrated ion. Smaller ions typically have lower
							mobility because they tend to be more heavily hydrated (surrounded
							by water molecules), which increases their effective size and
							reduces mobility. Larger ions are less hydrated and can move more
							freely, leading to higher mobility.
						</p>
						<p>
							1. NaCl (Sodium chloride): Sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) are
							relatively small and heavily hydrated, which reduces their
							mobility.
						</p>
						<p>
							2. LiCl (Lithium chloride): Lithium ions (Li<sup>+</sup>) are even
							smaller than sodium ions and are even more heavily hydrated,

							3. CsCl (Cesium chloride): Cesium ions (Cs<sup>+</sup>) are large,
