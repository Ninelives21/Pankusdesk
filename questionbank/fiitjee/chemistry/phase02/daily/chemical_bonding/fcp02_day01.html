							Ionic Mobility: In an aqueous solution, ionic mobility depends on

							1. NaCl (Sodium chloride): Sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) are

							2. CrO<sub>3</sub> (Chromium trioxide) has chromium in a high
							oxidation state (+6), making it more covalent in nature.
						</p>
						<p>
							3. MnO (Manganese(II) oxide) is the most ionic compound among the
							options because it involves manganese in a low oxidation state
							(+2), combined with oxygen, leading to a higher degree of ionic
							character.
						</p>
						<p>
							4. Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (Manganese(VII) oxide) is more
							covalent due to the high oxidation state (+7) of manganese.
