							statement(s) is/are correct regarding ionic compounds?
							<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A) They are good

					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p><strong>Correct Answers:</strong> (B), (C), (D)</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (A):</strong> This statement is incorrect. Ionic
								compounds are not good conductors of electricity at room
								temperature when they are in a solid state because the ions are
								fixed in place and cannot move freely. However, when ionic
								compounds are in a molten state or dissolved in water, the ions
								are free to move, and they do conduct electricity.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (B):</strong> This statement is correct. Ionic
								compounds are generally more soluble in polar solvents than
								covalent compounds. Polar solvents like water stabilize the
								separated ions, making it more favorable for ionic compounds to
								dissolve.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (C):</strong> This statement is correct. Ionic
								compounds are composed of positively charged cations and
								negatively charged anions. The electrostatic attraction between
								these oppositely charged ions forms the ionic bond.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (D):</strong> This statement is correct. Ionic
								compounds typically have high melting and boiling points due to
								the strong electrostatic forces between the ions. These forces
								require a significant amount of energy to overcome, leading to
								higher melting and boiling points compared to covalent
								compounds.

						</a>
					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p><strong>Correct Answers:</strong> (B), (C), (D)</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (A):</strong> This statement is incorrect. While
								ionic compounds do have high melting points, they do not
								necessarily have low boiling points. Both their melting and
								boiling points are typically high due to the strong
								electrostatic forces between the ions.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (B):</strong> This statement is correct. Ionic
								compounds typically have high melting points and nondirectional
								bonds due to the strong electrostatic attraction between the
								oppositely charged ions.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (C):</strong> This statement is correct. Ionic
								compounds are generally highly soluble in polar solvents (like
								water) due to the attraction between the ions and the dipole of
								the solvent molecules. However, they have low solubilities in
								nonpolar solvents where such interactions do not occur.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (D):</strong> This statement is also correct.
								Ionic compounds form three-dimensional network structures and
								are good conductors of electricity in the molten state because
								the ions are free to move.

					<button class="accordion-button" id="Q3">

							<span class="ques_number_very_imp">3.</span> Point out the correct
							statement(s) amongst the following
							<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A) Sodium salts are
							much more soluble than ammonium salts
							<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) SnCl<sub>2</sub> is

							<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (D) Calcium fluoride is
							more ionic than calcium iodide.
						</a>
					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p><strong>Correct Answers:</strong> (A), (B), (C), (D)</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (A):</strong> Sodium salts are generally more
								soluble than ammonium salts due to the smaller size of the
								sodium ion, which allows it to more effectively interact with
								water molecules and dissolve.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (B):</strong> SnCl₂ is indeed ionic due to the
								lower oxidation state of tin (+2), which results in an ionic
								bond. However, SnCl₄, with tin in a higher oxidation state (+4),
								exhibits significant covalent character due to increased
								polarization of the chloride ions by the tin cation.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (C):</strong> NH₃ is less polar than BF₃. BF₃ is
								a planar molecule with symmetrical distribution of charges,
								making it non-polar, while NH₃ is a polar molecule due to its
								trigonal pyramidal shape and the presence of a lone pair on
								nitrogen, which creates a dipole moment.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (D):</strong> Calcium fluoride (CaF₂) is more
								ionic than calcium iodide (CaI₂) due to the higher
								electronegativity difference between calcium and fluorine
								compared to calcium and iodine. The greater the difference in
								electronegativity, the more ionic the bond.

								These questions consist of two statements each, printed
								STATEMENT–1 and STATEMENT–2. While answering these questions,
								you are required to choose any one of the following four
								response OPTIONS:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									(A) STATEMENT–1 is True, STATEMENT–2 is True; STATEMENT–2 is a
									correct explanation for STATEMENT–1
								</li>
								<li>
									(B) STATEMENT–1 is True, STATEMENT–2 is True; STATEMENT–2 is
									NOT a correct Explanation for STATEMENT–1
								</li>
								<li>(C) STATEMENT–1 is True, STATEMENT–2 is False</li>
								<li>(D) STATEMENT–1 is False, STATEMENT–2 is True</li>
							</ul>
							<br />
							<strong>STATEMENT–1 :</strong> PbF<sub>4</sub> exists while
							PbI<sub>4</sub> does not
							<br />
							<strong>and</strong>
							<br />
							<strong>STATEMENT–2 :</strong> F has more electron affinity
							compared to I.
						</a>
					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p>
							<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> (B) STATEMENT–1 is True,
							STATEMENT–2 is True; STATEMENT–2 is NOT a correct Explanation for
							STATEMENT–1.
						</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Statement 1:</strong> Lead (IV) fluoride
								(PbF<sub>4</sub>) exists because fluorine, being highly
								electronegative and small, stabilizes the +4 oxidation state of
								lead. PbI<sub>4</sub> does not exist because iodine is less
								electronegative and larger, making it less effective at
								stabilizing the +4 oxidation state of lead.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Statement 2:</strong> Fluorine has a higher electron
								affinity than iodine due to its smaller size and stronger
								attraction for an additional electron.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Conclusion:</strong> Although Statement 2 is true, it is
								not the reason why PbF₄ exists and PbI₄ does not. Therefore,
								Statement 2 is NOT a correct explanation for Statement 1.

								electronegativity between the two atoms, facilitating the
								transfer of electrons.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Size of Cations and Anions:</strong> The cation should

						</a>
					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p><strong>Correct Answers:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (A):</strong> Oxygen (O) and Sodium (Na) form an
								ionic bond. Na loses one electron to form \( \text{Na}^+ \) and
								O gains two electrons to form \( \text{O}^{2-} \). This creates
								a strong ionic bond.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (B):</strong> Fluorine (F) and Sodium (Na) also
								form an ionic bond. Na loses one electron to form \( \text{Na}^+
								\) and F gains one electron to form \( \text{F}^- \), resulting
								in an ionic bond.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (C):</strong> Oxygen (O) and Neon (Ne) are
								unlikely to form a bond as Neon is a noble gas and does not
								easily form bonds. The interaction between them would only
								involve Van der Waals forces, which are much weaker than ionic
								or covalent bonds.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Choice (D):</strong> Two Fluorine (F) atoms form a
								covalent bond by sharing one pair of electrons, resulting in a

							<span class="ques_number">7.</span> CuCl has less melting point

						</a>
					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p>
							<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> The melting point of a compound
							depends on the strength of the bonds holding its atoms together.
							Since Cu has a 'Pseudo Noble Gas Configuration', it has more
							covalent character than NaCl. The partial covalent character makes
							the bonds in CuCl weaker than the purely ionic bonds in NaCl,
							resulting in a lower melting point for CuCl.

							<span class="ques_number">8.</span> Out of MgO and NaCl which has
							higher lattice energy and why?
						</a>
					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p>
							<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> The lattice energy of a compound
							depends on the charge of the ions and the size of the ions
							involved. Lattice energy is directly proportional to the product
							of the charges of the ions and inversely proportional to the sum
							of the ionic radii.
						</p>
						<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>MgO</strong> has a higher lattice energy than
								<strong>NaCl</strong> because:
							</li>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The charge on the ions in MgO is greater (Mg²⁺ and O²⁻)
									compared to NaCl (Na⁺ and Cl⁻).
								</li>
								<li>
									Although both Mg²⁺ and Na⁺ are cations, Mg²⁺ has a higher
									charge than Na⁺, and similarly, O²⁻ has a higher charge than
									Cl⁻.
								</li>
								<li>
									The greater charges on the ions in MgO result in a stronger
									electrostatic attraction between the ions, leading to higher
									lattice energy.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The higher charge and smaller size
								of the ions in MgO compared to NaCl lead to a higher lattice
								energy for MgO.
