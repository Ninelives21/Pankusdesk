							group for alkali metals.
							<br />
							and
							<br />
							STATEMENT-2: Alkali metals show decreasing ionization energy trend
							of Li > Na > K > Rb > Cs.
						</a>
					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Statement-1:</strong> Polarization power of cations
								decreases down the group for alkali metals. This is true
								because, as you move down the group in the periodic table, the
								size of the cations increases. Larger cations have lower charge
								density, which means their ability to polarize (or distort) the
								electron cloud of nearby anions is reduced. Therefore, the
								polarization power decreases down the group.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Statement-2:</strong> Alkali metals show a decreasing
								ionization energy trend from Li > Na > K > Rb > Cs. This is also
								true. Ionization energy decreases down the group because the
								outermost electrons are further from the nucleus and are more
								easily removed due to the increased atomic radius and electron
								shielding effect.
							</li>
							<li>
								However,
								<strong
									>Statement-2 does not directly explain Statement-1.</strong
								>
								The decrease in polarization power down the group is primarily
								due to the increase in cation size, not the trend in ionization
								energy. Therefore, while both statements are true, Statement-2
								is not the correct explanation for Statement-1.

							<span class="ques_number">5.</span>
							STATEMENT-1: Sn<sup>2+</sup> oxidation state is more stable than
							Sn<sup>4+</sup>
							<br />
							and
							<br />
							STATEMENT-2: Sn<sup>2+</sup> has less polarization power than
							Sn<sup>4+</sup>
						</a>
					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Statement-1:</strong> Sn²⁺ oxidation state is more
								stable than Sn⁴⁺. This is false. For tin (Sn), the +4 oxidation
								state is generally more stable than the +2 oxidation state. The
								stability of the +4 state is due to the fact that tin, being in
								Group 14, has four valence electrons that can be involved in
								bonding. The +4 state allows tin to achieve a stable, full octet
								configuration. The +2 state is less stable and can be more
								easily oxidized to the +4 state, especially in the presence of
								strong oxidizing agents.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Statement-2:</strong> Sn²⁺ has less polarization power
								than Sn⁴⁺. This is true. The polarization power of a cation is
								related to its charge density (charge/size). Sn⁴⁺, with a higher
								charge, has a higher charge density compared to Sn²⁺, making it
								more effective at polarizing nearby anions. This increased
								polarization power contributes to the formation of more covalent
								character in compounds containing Sn⁴⁺.
							</li>
							<li>
								Therefore,
								<strong>Statement-1 is False, and Statement-2 is True.</strong>
								The polarization power of Sn²⁺ and Sn⁴⁺ is related to their
								charge density, but this does not explain the stability of the
								oxidation states. The inert pair effect, not polarization power,
								is the primary reason for the greater stability of Sn²⁺ in some
								cases, but overall, Sn⁴⁺ is more stable.

							character:
							<br />
							(a) CuCl, NaCl
							<br />
							(b) NaF, Na<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>3</sub>N
							<br />
							(c) NaF, NaCl, NaBr, NaI
						</a>
					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>(a) CuCl > NaCl:</strong>
								<br />
								CuCl has a higher covalent character than NaCl.
								<br />
								<strong>Reasoning:</strong> Cu²⁺ is smaller and has a higher
								charge density compared to Na⁺, which increases the covalent
								character in CuCl. The chloride ion (Cl⁻) is the same in both
								cases, so the difference in covalent character is due to the
								cation.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>(b) Na₃N > Na₂O > NaF:</strong>
								<br />
								Na₃N has the highest covalent character followed by Na₂O and
								then NaF.
								<br />
								<strong>Reasoning:</strong> Nitride ion (N³⁻) has the largest
								size and highest polarizability, leading to more covalent
								character. Oxide ion (O²⁻) is smaller and less polarizable than
								nitride, so it has less covalent character than Na₃N. Fluoride
								ion (F⁻) is the smallest and least polarizable, resulting in the
								least covalent character.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>(c) NaI > NaBr > NaCl > NaF:</strong>
								<br />
								NaI has the highest covalent character, followed by NaBr, NaCl,
								and NaF.
								<br />
								<strong>Reasoning:</strong> Iodide ion (I⁻) is the largest and
								most polarizable, leading to the highest covalent character. As
								you move up the halogens (from I⁻ to F⁻), the size decreases,
								and polarizability decreases, reducing the covalent character.

						</a>
					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
						<p>
							The nature of bonding in SnCl₂ and SnCl₄ can be explained by
							Fajan's Rule:
							<br /><br />
							<strong>Fajan's Rule:</strong> More the charge on the cation, more
							is the covalent character of the compound. SnCl₄ is more covalent
							in nature because the Sn⁴⁺ ion has a higher charge compared to the
							Sn²⁺ ion in SnCl₂. The higher charge on Sn⁴⁺ increases its
							polarizing power, leading to a greater distortion of the electron
							cloud of the chloride ions (Cl⁻), which results in stronger
							covalent bonds in SnCl₄. <br /><br />
							Therefore, SnCl₄ is more covalent, while SnCl₂, with the lower
							charge on Sn²⁺, is more ionic.
