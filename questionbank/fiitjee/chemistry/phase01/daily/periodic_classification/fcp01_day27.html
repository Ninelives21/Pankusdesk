					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Fully filled and half filled</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Beryllium (Be):</strong> Beryllium has an electron
								configuration of 1s²2s². The 2s orbital is fully filled, making
								it stable. Adding an extra electron would require placing it in
								a higher energy 2p orbital, which is not favorable. Therefore,
								Beryllium has a low electron affinity due to its
								<strong>fully filled</strong> orbital.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Nitrogen (N):</strong> Nitrogen has an electron
								configuration of 1s²2s²2p³. The p orbital is half-filled, which
								is a stable configuration due to exchange energy. Adding an
								extra electron would disrupt this stability by pairing up one of
								the p electrons, which is not energetically favorable. Thus,
								Nitrogen has a low electron affinity due to its
								<strong>half filled</strong> orbital.

								The atomic weight of Fluorine (F) is 19 amu. The number of moles

								Number of moles = Mass / Molar mass = 1 gram / 19 grams/mole =

					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p>
							<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> (A) \(O^-\) ion will tend to
							resist the addition of another electron.
						</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>First Step (Exothermic):</strong> The first step
								involves the addition of one electron to an oxygen atom to form
								\(O^-\). This process is exothermic, meaning it releases energy
								because the oxygen atom has a high electron affinity and readily
								gains an electron.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Second Step (Endothermic):</strong> The second step
								involves the addition of another electron to the \(O^-\) ion to
								form \(O_2^{2-}\). This process is endothermic, meaning it
								requires energy input because the \(O^-\) ion, having already
								gained one electron, experiences repulsion from the incoming
								second electron. This makes it difficult to add another
								electron, thus requiring energy input.

							<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> (D) Energy released when an

						</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Electron Affinity Definition:</strong> Electron affinity
								is the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a
								neutral atom in the gaseous state to form a negative ion. This
								process typically releases energy, which is why electron
								affinity is usually considered a negative value (though
								sometimes it’s represented as positive to indicate the
								magnitude).
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Review of the Options:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<strong>(A):</strong> This describes ionization energy, not
										electron affinity. Ionization energy is the energy required
										to remove an electron.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>(B):</strong> This describes electronegativity,
										which is a measure of how strongly an atom attracts
										electrons in a chemical bond.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>(C):</strong> This describes a scenario where energy
										is absorbed during electron addition, which is incorrect for
										electron affinity because it usually releases energy.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>(D):</strong> This correctly defines electron
										affinity as the energy released when an electron is added to
										an atom.

					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">

							<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> (B) Second electron affinity of
							oxygen
						</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Endothermic Process Definition:</strong> An endothermic
								process is one that absorbs energy (heat) from its surroundings.
								In the context of electron affinity, an endothermic process
								involves energy being absorbed when an electron is added to an
								atom or ion.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Review of the Options:</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<strong>(A):</strong> The first electron affinity of
										chlorine is an exothermic process because energy is released
										when a chlorine atom gains an electron to form Cl⁻.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>(B):</strong> The second electron affinity of oxygen
										is an endothermic process. When an additional electron is
										added to O⁻ to form O²⁻, energy must be absorbed to overcome
										the electron-electron repulsion in the already negatively
										charged ion.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>(C):</strong> The formation of NaCl from gaseous
										ions is an exothermic process as energy is released when Na⁺
										and Cl⁻ combine to form NaCl.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>(D):</strong> The hydration of MgCl₂ is also an
										exothermic process as energy is released when MgCl₂
										dissolves in water and interacts with water molecules.

					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p>
							<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> (A) Fluorine has the highest
							electron affinity
						</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>(A):</strong> This statement is incorrect. Chlorine, not
								fluorine, has the highest electron affinity. Although fluorine
								is more electronegative, its small atomic size results in
								significant electron-electron repulsion when an additional
								electron is added, making chlorine's electron affinity higher.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>(B):</strong> This statement is generally true. As the
								nuclear charge increases, the attraction for the added electron
								also increases, leading to a higher electron affinity.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>(C):</strong> This statement is correct. The electron
								affinity of nitrogen is positive, meaning energy is absorbed
								when an electron is added. This is due to the stability of its
								half-filled p-orbital.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>(D):</strong> This statement is correct. Chlorine has
								the highest electron affinity among the elements because of its
								optimal size and high electronegativity.

								The ionization energy of F⁻ (the energy required to remove an

						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>

						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>(A) Na⁺ < F⁻ < O²⁻ < N³⁻: (S) Ionic size</strong> — The

							</li>
							<li>
								<strong
									>(B) Li⁺ < Na⁺ < K⁺ < Rb⁺ < Cs⁺: (Q) Mobility of hydrated
									ions</strong
								>
								— Smaller ions like Li⁺ have stronger hydration, reducing
								mobility. As the size of the ion increases down the group, the
								mobility of the hydrated ion also increases.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>(C) O < S < F < Cl: (P) Electron affinity</strong> —
								Electron affinity generally increases across a period from left
								to right, with chlorine having a higher electron affinity than
								fluorine due to its optimal size, which minimizes electron

							</li>
							<li>
								<strong
									>(D) Cl⁻ < K⁺ < Ca²⁺ < Sc³⁺: (P) Electron affinity, (R)

								— This option corresponds to both electron affinity and
