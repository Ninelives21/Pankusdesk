						</a>
					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Fully filled and half filled</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Beryllium (Be):</strong> Beryllium has an electron
								configuration of 1s²2s². The 2s orbital is fully filled, making
								it stable. Adding an extra electron would require placing it in
								a higher energy 2p orbital, which is not favorable. Therefore,
								Beryllium has a low electron affinity due to its
								<strong>fully filled</strong> orbital.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Nitrogen (N):</strong> Nitrogen has an electron
								configuration of 1s²2s²2p³. The p orbital is half-filled, which
								is a stable configuration due to exchange energy. Adding an
								extra electron would disrupt this stability by pairing up one of
								the p electrons, which is not energetically favorable. Thus,
								Nitrogen has a low electron affinity due to its
								<strong>half filled</strong> orbital.

						</a>
					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 3.76 K.Cal</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The atomic weight of Fluorine (F) is 19 amu. The number of moles
								of Fluorine in 1 gram is calculated as:
								<br />
								Number of moles = Mass / Molar mass = 1 gram / 19 grams/mole =
								1/19 moles
							</li>
							<li>
								The electron affinity (EA) of Fluorine is given as 3.1 eV. The
								energy released per mole of Fluorine in K.Cal is:
								<br />
								Energy released per mole = 3.1 eV × 23.06 K.Cal/mole = 71.486
								K.Cal/mole
							</li>
							<li>
								The total energy released for 1 gram of Fluorine is:
								<br />
								Total energy released = Energy per mole × Number of moles =
								71.486 K.Cal/mole × 1/19 moles = 3.76 K.Cal

						<p>
							<strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Approximately 1.66 × 10<sup

							Cl atoms
						</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The energy required to remove an electron from Cl<sup>–</sup>
								(to ionize Cl<sup>–</sup>) is 13.0 eV (Ionization Potential,
								IP).
							</li>
							<li>
								The energy released when an electron is added to a neutral Cl
								atom to form Cl<sup>–</sup> is 3.60 eV (Electron Affinity, EA).
							</li>
							<li>
								For one Avogadro number of Cl atoms (6 × 10<sup>23</sup> atoms),
								the total energy released is:
								<br />
								Total Energy Released = 3.60 eV × 6 × 10<sup>23</sup> atoms
							</li>
							<li>
								The number of Cl atoms that can be ionized by this energy is
								calculated as:
								<br />
								Number of Cl atoms ionized = (3.60 eV × 6 × 10<sup>23</sup>) /
								13.0 eV
								<br />
								Number of Cl atoms ionized = 1.66 × 10<sup>23</sup> atoms

						</a>
					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> 4.80 kcal</p>
						<strong>Explanation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The atomic weight of Chlorine (Cl) is 35.5 amu. The number of
								moles of Chlorine in 2 grams is calculated as:
								<br />
								Number of moles = Mass / Molar mass = 2 grams / 35.5 grams/mole
								≈ 0.0563 moles
							</li>
							<li>
								The electron gain enthalpy (EA) of Chlorine is given as 3.7 eV.
								The energy released per mole of Chlorine in kcal is:
								<br />
								Energy released per mole = 3.7 eV × 23.06 kcal/mole = 85.322
								kcal/mole
							</li>
							<li>
								The total energy released for 2 grams of Chlorine is:
								<br />
								Total energy released = Energy per mole × Number of moles =
								85.322 kcal/mole × 0.0563 moles ≈ 4.80 kcal
