					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p>
							To determine which of the ions Na<sup>-</sup>, Mg<sup>-</sup>,
							Al<sup>-</sup>, Si<sup>-</sup> is the least stable, we must
							analyze their electronic configurations and energy levels:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Na<sup>-</sup>:</strong> The electronic configuration of
								Na<sup>-</sup> is \(1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2\). Sodium naturally
								prefers to lose its 3s electron to achieve a noble gas
								configuration. Adding an electron to fill the 3s orbital is
								unfavorable, but not the most unstable because it stays within
								the same energy level.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Mg<sup>-</sup>:</strong> The electronic configuration of
								Mg<sup>-</sup> is \(1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^1\). Magnesium
								prefers to lose two electrons to form Mg<sup>2+</sup> with a
								stable noble gas configuration. Adding an electron to the
								higher-energy 3p orbital is highly unfavorable, making Mg<sup
									>-</sup
								>
								the most unstable ion.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Al<sup>-</sup>:</strong> The electronic configuration of
								Al<sup>-</sup> is \(1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^2\). Aluminum prefers
								to lose three electrons, but the added electron results in a
								partially filled 3p orbital, making it slightly more stable than
								Mg<sup>-</sup>.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Si<sup>-</sup>:</strong> The electronic configuration of
								Si<sup>-</sup> is \(1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^3\). Silicon is more
								electronegative and the 3p^3 configuration is relatively stable
								due to the half-filled orbital, making Si<sup>-</sup> the most
								stable among the four ions.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							<strong>Comparison:</strong> Mg<sup>-</sup> is the least stable
							ion because the extra electron occupies a higher-energy 3p
							orbital, which magnesium typically does not fill, resulting in
							significant instability. Na<sup>-</sup>, while unstable, does not
							introduce a new subshell. Al<sup>-</sup> and Si<sup>-</sup> are
							more stable due to their more favorable electronic configurations.
						</p>
						<p>Therefore, the correct answer is Mg<sup>-</sup>.</p>

					</button>
					<div class="accordion-content ans-align">
						<p>
							The decrease in size between Li and Be is more pronounced because
							the electrons in Li and Be are closer to the nucleus. This
							stronger attraction to the nucleus in Li and Be causes a
							significant reduction in atomic size compared to Na and Mg or K
							and Ca, where electrons are in higher energy levels and farther
							from the nucleus.

							<li>
								<strong>B<sup>3+</sup>:</strong> The B<sup>3+</sup> ion has lost

								<strong>Dipositive Lithium (Li<sup>2+</sup>):</strong> Li<sup

								because it has no charge.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							<strong>Conclusion:</strong> Dipositive Lithium (Li<sup>2+</sup>)

							The Van der Waals radius is a measure of the size of an atom or

							become significant. These forces are most relevant in the solid

							being chemically bonded. Therefore, the Van der Waals radius is

						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Why the other choices are incorrect:</strong>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>(A) Molecular substances in gaseous state only:</strong>
								In the gaseous state, molecules are far apart and the concept of
								Van der Waals radius is less relevant because the weak
								intermolecular forces are not as significant.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>(C) Molecular substances in liquid state only:</strong>
								In the liquid state, while molecules are closer than in the gas
								phase, they are not as tightly packed as in the solid state. The
								Van der Waals radius is less significant compared to the solid
								state.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>(D) Molecular substances in any state:</strong> While
								Van der Waals forces exist in all states of matter, the radius
