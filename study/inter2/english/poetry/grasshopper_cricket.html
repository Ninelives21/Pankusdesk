		<h2>Poetry: On the Grasshopper and Cricket</h2>
		<h3>By John Keats</h3>
		<h3>Question and Answers</h3>
		<p><em>Answer the following in about 100 words each.</em></p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong
					>What is the theme of the poem “On the Grasshopper and
					Cricket”?</strong
				><br />
				<p>
					John Keats, a Romantic poet, is the author of the poem “On the
					Grasshopper and Cricket” in which he celebrates the music of the earth
					and the ever-present symphony of nature. This poem with 14 lines is
					called a sonnet. The first part (octave) talks about the Grasshopper
					and the second part of six lines is devoted to the Cricket.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nature is the central focus of the poem. The poet says that the poetry
					of the earth never ceases. The Grasshopper and Cricket are used as
					symbols. Seasons may come and go, but nature never fails to inspire us
					with its songs. When birds stop singing in extreme heat, the earth is
					filled with the songs of the Grasshopper. He sings endlessly, but when
					tired, rests under some pleasant weed. During winter, birds stop
					singing. The silence can be frightening. Frost spreads its blanket
					over nature. Invariably, a shrill sound comes from beneath the stones,
					and it is the Cricket singing. The Cricket’s song restores warmth.

					During the cold winter season, the birds stop singing and seek shelter
					in their nests. There is an eerie silence and frost covers the earth
					like a blanket. Even then, the poetry of the earth continues through a
					shrill sound heard from beneath the stones. It restores warmth and
					comfort. Thus, the Cricket takes up the responsibility of singing the
					glory of nature during winter. It proves to the world that the poetry
					of the earth can never cease.

				<strong>When does a Grasshopper sing?</strong><br />

				<p>
					The poet says that the poetry of the earth never ceases whether it is
					scorching summer or freezing winter. Nature sings through the mediums
					of the Grasshopper and the Cricket symbolizing optimism and joy.
					During the hot summer, the birds are tired and stop singing. But we
					can still listen to the voice of the Grasshopper running from hedge to
					hedge. The fun-loving creature finally takes rest under “cooling
					trees” and “pleasant weeds”. The Grasshopper celebrates the beauty of
					summer through his songs.

				<p>
					The poem is symbolic because the Grasshopper represents scorching
					summer and the Cricket, the freezing winter. Nature is the central
					focus with her constant presence, providing unending delight. She is a
					spontaneous source of optimism and happiness. Both the Grasshopper and
					the Cricket are the representative voices of nature’s music. Both
					offer a soothing effect during the extremities of climate. The
					Grasshopper’s song balances the extreme heat of summer and Cricket’s
					song is both comforting and pleasing during winter. Both can produce a
					characteristic, loud, and chirping sound. Through a joyous and
					luxurious setting, the poem celebrates all phases of nature.
