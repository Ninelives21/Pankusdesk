					The poem ‘Awake’ is written by Sarojini Naidu. She is fondly called
					the ‘Nightingale of India’. She was a child prodigy. She started
					writing poems in English when she was just twelve. As a writer, she
					was both prolific and profound. She was the first woman to be the
					Governor of a state in independent India. The poem is a patriotic

					Yes, Sarojini Naidu’s song ‘Awake’ has been acclaimed as a patriotic
					lyric. The word ‘lyric’ comes from the Greek expression <em>lyre</em>
					– a musical instrument. A lyric is a poem in which a single speaker
					expresses emotions and thoughts. It is noteworthy for its musical
					quality and rhythm. And its theme is lofty. The poem ‘Awake’ has all
					these qualities in abundance. It is rich in musical element. It
					expresses strong nationalistic feelings. Thus, the content is
					patriotic and hence noble. With its profound theme and artistic and
					lyrical form, the poem is entitled to be applauded as a patriotic

					Nation is personified as our mother. All Indians become her children.
					They implore the mother to wake up from the shackles of slavery and
					bondage of sorrow. They assure her that the dream of freedom will
					become a reality. Hence she should break the woes of bondage. They beg
					her to help them serve her and worship her. They want her to bless
					them so that their holy cause may triumph. They have inherited her
					moral and spiritual courage. They desire to restore her past
					splendour. Such is the dedication of her children and they want her to
					respond to their call.

					The children of mother India are devoted to her. They are ever ready
					to serve her. First, they want her to break the chains of slavery.
					They have inherited her pride, her moral and spiritual courage. They
					pledge to safeguard her and they will not abandon her come what may.
					Through their united efforts, they would make her glorious. The
					followers of different religions would come together and their devoted
					efforts shall be sufficient to emancipate her from the present
					subjugation. They affirm that their mother is their queen and goddess
					and as true servants they would unitedly celebrate her victory.

					People of all faith pledge to come together and reinstate the pride
					and power India once basked in. The Hindus swear that they will
					worship her by offering flowers and safeguard her pride. The Parsees
					promise that the fire of hope which burns in their hearts will be
					dedicated to her service. The Mussalmans declare that they would
					defend her like the sword of the love that is used to protect their
					religion. The Christians promise that they will have the same faith in
					her as they have in their religion. People of all creeds shall unite
					to raise aloft the glory and honour of their mother, their queen and
					goddess and see that it is never soiled. The poem is a soul-stirring
					appeal to all Indians to keep aside religious differences and work
					unitedly for a common cause.
