			<h2>Poetry: Fear</h2>
			<h3>Question and Answers</h3>
			<p><em>Answer the following in about 100 words each.</em></p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>What is the central idea of the poem ‘Fear’?</strong><br />
					<p>
						The poem ‘Fear’ is written by Kahlil Gibran. The philosophical poem
						portrays the universal fear that everyone faces in life. The poet
						shares his profound wisdom about overcoming ‘Fear’ through the point
						of view of a river.
					</p>
					<p>
						The starting line itself introduces the central theme of the poem
						‘Fear’. The river’s fear of merging in the ocean refers to a number
						of human emotions. The fear of changing consciousness, the terror of
						moving forward and the anxiety of losing oneself. The poem ‘Fear’
						gives us a glimpse of how a river feels when it travels through
						mountains and plains to merge with an ocean. The poet personifies
						the river as a woman to infuse life. There is always a desire to ‘go
						back’ which is impossible in existence. Finally, Gibran concludes
						the poem with a strong message that one should accept the fact that
						there is no other option except to move forward — overcoming fear.

						The river trembles with fear at the sight of the vast ocean. She
						tries to flow back in the path she has travelled. But she realizes
						at last that going back is impossible and moving ahead is
						inevitable. Human beings fear moving forward at some point in life
						and try to ‘go back’ escaping from the adverse circumstances. The
						fear of changing consciousness, the terror of moving forward and the
						anxiety of losing oneself are the reasons which make them ‘go back’.
						They learn that going back is impossible and moving ahead is
						inevitable in the existence of life. So, all of us have to take the
						risk of facing challenging situations to overcome the various
						hurdles in life.

					<p>
						Everyone meets fear at some point in life. It may be the fear of
						moving forward, the terror of losing our personal identity or our
						personal belongings, being forgotten in this universe, death,
						change, and so on. So, in order to escape from the clutches of fear,
						one tries to traverse in the path of the past. But going back is
						impossible and moving ahead is inevitable. In this process of
						escaping from fear they learn the reality; the reality of facing the
						risk and overcoming fear. One has to face the ups and downs in life,
						thereby converting fear into our greatest strength to achieve
						success in life.

					</p>
					<p>
						Gibran refers to the river as ‘she’ to infuse life into the river.
						The river is beautifully personified adopting many human traits. The
						river trembles with fear at the sight of a vast ocean after
						traversing many difficult paths in her life. She tries to flow back
						in order to escape from entering the ocean. But going back and
						dwelling in the past again is impossible in the existence of
						everyone’s life. In a similar way, moving ahead is inevitable.
						Finally, after a great inner conflict, she realizes that “She needs
						to take the risk of entering the ocean.” She understands that it is
						not the risk of losing her identity; instead, it is the truth of
						becoming a part of something great and vast.
