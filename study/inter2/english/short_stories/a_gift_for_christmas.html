					The theme of the story ‘A Gift for Christmas’ is that the greatest
					gift of all is unconditional love. The story highlights the valuable
					possessions of mankind like love, sacrifice and generosity. The story
					narrates the tale of a young couple. Jim and Della long to give each
					other meaningful Christmas presents. The couple is constrained by
					their meagre budget. Della sells her beautiful long hair in order to
					buy a platinum watch chain for Jim’s antique gold watch and Jim sells
					his watch to buy Della a set of combs. Henry brings out the importance
					of certain virtuous human characteristics. In the beginning of the
					story, Della could do nothing except to throw herself on the dirty
					little couch and cry. But immediately behaves like a mature woman
					having decided to sell her long, flowing hair to buy Jim a present.
					When Jim entered the house, Della, like a loving wife longed for his
					attention as she was scared of his anger. When Della opened the
					package brought by Jim, we could visualize the scream of joy followed
					by a quick feminine change to tears. She can adjust herself easily
					according to circumstances. A wonderful character indeed is Della!

					The theme of the story is that the greatest gift of all is
					unconditional love. The story narrates the tale of a young couple, Jim
					and his wife Della. Jim looked thin and very serious. He was only
					twenty-two – too young to shoulder the responsibility of a family. The
					couple long to give each other meaningful Christmas presents. But they
					constrained by their meagre budget. Jim’s gold watch and Della’s long
					beautiful hair are what they consider their treasures. Della sold her
					long flowing hair and bought a platinum watch chain for him. Jim was
					also facing the same financial crunch. He could not decide what to buy
					for Della. Finally, he decided to buy a set of combs, with such
					turmoil in mind, he atlast decided to buy a set of combs. The set of
					combs, that Della had seen in a Broadway window and liked so much. Jim
					was loving and wise enough to buy the set of combs as a gift for
					Della. Poor man! Though he was in need of a new overcoat and a pair of
					gloves, he decided to buy the combs by selling his Gold watch
					illustrates his love for Della.

					The theme of the story is that the greatest gift of all is
					unconditional love. The story highlights the valuable possessions of
					Mankind. The story tells the tale of a young couple. Jim and Della
					long to give each other meaningful Christmas presents. The irony which
					Henry presents in his short story teaches the reader about sacrifice
					and true love. Henry uses verbal irony after revealing that Della had
					only $1.87 for gifts. Della could only flop down on the shabby little
					couch and weep bitterly. This indicates that life is made up of sobs,
					sniffles and smiles. A situation in the story is made humorous or
					suspense filled when the author makes the reader know more about it
					than a character. This is what is called dramatic irony. The situation
					is ironic for Della because she wanted a pair of tortoise shell combs,
					but when she was gifted the same she had no long hair to style it into
					curls. In the same way, when Jim received a platinum watch chain for
					his watch, there is no watch at all! Jim and Della who are a ‘made for
					each other couple’ exhibit unconditional love through their praise
					worthy actions.
