		<h2>Short Stories: An Interview</h2>
		<h3>By Richard Gordon</h3>
		<h3>Paragraph Answers</h3>
		<p><em>Answer the following in about 100 words each.</em></p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong
					>The narrator thought that his interview was superfluous. Why?</strong
				><br />
				<p>
					Richard Gordon was an English surgeon. He wrote numerous novels and
					screen plays for television and films. His ‘Doctor Novels’ - eighteen
					comic works in a series were very successful. The short story “An
					Interview” is witty and apparently autobiographical. It discusses the
					narrator’s experience of facing an interview with the Dean of a
					medical school. The style is racy and simple.
				</p>
				<p>
					The narrator came to attend an interview with Dr. Lionel Loftus, the
					dean of St Swithin’s medical school. He sat nervously in the waiting
					area. He was then encountered by an old man, the secretary of the
					medical school who scanned him carefully and asked a few questions.
					Unlike what was expected, the Dean also didn’t ask any questions
					related to medicine. He asked only about the narrator’s rugby
					experience, with which the Dean seemed impressed. As a result, the
					narrator got admitted into St Swithin’s. Later, he came to know all
					that was unnecessary. The Dean generally admitted students whom the
					secretary approved of and rejected those whose looks the secretary
					didn’t like.

					Why?</strong

					Mr. Richard Gordon went to meet the Dean after an encounter with the
					secretary. The narrator was worried and tensed about his admission.
					Mr. Lionel Loftus, the secretary had given an excuse for keeping the
					narrator waiting and offered him a seat. Now, The Dean began asking
					the narrator questions about whether he was from a public school,
					whether he could afford the fee, etc. He also asked whether the
					narrator played Rugby and his position in the game. The Dean was
					interested in the candidate’s position at three quarter in Rugby as
					the hospital was full of forwards. It looked as if the Dean was
					impressed with the young and energetic narrator who could do his
					duties well if given a chance.

					The narrator wanted to meet the Dean, Dr. Lionel Loftus. So, he went
					to the office, sat in the waiting room, worried about his admission.
					After some time, an old man, so thin, so pale, entered the room slowly
					and informed Mr. Gordon that he was not the dean but the secretary of
					the medical college. He said that he had seen thousands of students
					pass through the school where some of them turned out good and some of
					them bad. He also said that he had seen the Dean himself come up for
					admission. The secretary put a few questions to the narrator as though
					he wanted to test his abilities. He asked if he was from a public
					school, played rugby, etc. Towards the end of the story, we understand
					that it is the secretary who decided whether a candidate is to be
					admitted or rejected.

					The Dean interviewed the narrator by asking him about his school,
					whether he could afford the fee, and his position in the Rugby team,
					etc. The narrator was puzzled because neither the secretary nor the
					Dean asked him any question related to medicine. The Dean seemed to be
					satisfied by the answers given by the narrator. He took pleasure in
					giving admission to Mr. Gordon at St. Swithins and congratulated him.
					The narrator wondered how he had been selected based on the questions
					asked. Later, he found out that the interview was superfluous since
					the Dean relied entirely on the opinion of his secretary and rejected
					the candidates whose looks the secretary disliked.
