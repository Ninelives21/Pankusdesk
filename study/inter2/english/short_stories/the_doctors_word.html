				<strong>Sketch the character of Dr. Raman.</strong><br />
				<p>
					The gripping short story ‘The Doctor’s Word’ was penned by R.K.
					Narayan, the most widely read writer of Indian literature in English.
					He wrote short stories, novels and essays. He won many awards like the
					Padma Bhushan, the Padma Vibhushan, Sahitya Academy Fellowship and
					A.C. Benson Medal. More importantly, he continues to win the hearts of
					readers from all over the globe.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Raman is the lead character in the story ‘The Doctor’s Word.’ The
					writer, R.K. Narayan, makes this clear in the title itself. Dr. Raman
					is an experienced practising medical man. He is an expert in his
					profession. His patients hold him in high regard. He is more a man of
					deeds than of words. He maintains a high standard of ethics. He never
					believes in soothing lies. He is truthful, hardworking and very
					dedicated and never left any stone unturned to save the lives of his
					patients. He works hard for hours, days or weeks till he wrests his
					prize from Yama’s hands. He respects human relations and values
					friendship. He is an outstanding doctor and a great human being.

					Dr. Raman is the lead character in the story ‘The Doctor’s Word.’ The
					writer, R.K. Narayan, makes this clear in the title itself. People
					always visited Dr. Raman only when the patient was on his last legs.
					It was because of his high fee and more importantly they liked to
					avoid the fact that the time had come to call in Dr. Raman. They also
					believed that something bad was going to happen for certain. Still,
					Dr. Raman never thought that it was his business to provide any
					unnecessary hope when as a matter of course Nature would tell them the
					truth in a few hours. However, if he glimpsed the faintest sign of
					hope in his patient, he rolled up his sleeves and stepped into the
					area of activity. It might be hours, days or weeks, but he never
					withdrew till he wrested the prize from Yama’s hands.

					Dr. Raman is the lead character in the story ‘The Doctor’s Word.’ The
					writer, R.K. Narayan, makes this clear in the title itself. One
					morning, Gopal’s son informs Dr. Raman at his clinic that his father
					is ill. He at once visits Gopal’s house. Gopal lies in bed as if in
					sleep. We understand from the doctor’s words that Gopal’s condition is
					rather hopeless. Dr. Raman asks Gopal’s wife why they couldn’t have
					sent a word to him about his ill health. He swings into action at
					once. He takes out an injection tube, the needle and injects the drug
					into Gopal’s body. Even after an hour of doctor’s keen observation,
					Gopal remains motionless. When Gopal shows a slight improvement, Dr.
					Raman ignores it by saying it is a false flash-up, very common in such
					situations. On sensing this, Gopal becomes very anxious and asks the
					doctor how long he is going to live. He asks thus as he has to sign
					the will. He can’t leave his property unsettled which will mean
					endless misery for his wife and children. Reminding Dr. Raman how
					harmful Subbaiah and his gang are, Gopal asks Dr. Raman to let him
					sign the will before it is too late.

					Dr. Raman is the lead character in the story ‘The Doctor’s Word.’ The
					writer, R.K. Narayan, makes this clear in the title itself. Dr. Raman
					knows pretty well about Gopal’s family affairs. He is well aware how
					ruthless Subbaiah and his gang are. If Gopal dies without signing the
					will, it will be a great misery to Gopal’s wife and children. This
					situation of Gopal’s family reminds him of the catchphrase of the
					people of Malgudi that he is not a mere doctor expressing an opinion,
					but a judge pronouncing a verdict. Then he says to himself, “If my
					word can save his life, he shall not die,” he at once decides to
					violate his usual practice of revealing the truth and do a piece of
					acting before a patient. He simulates a feeling and conceals his
					judgment, so as to save his friend’s life and says to Gopal, “Don’t
					worry about the will now. You are going to live. Your heart is
					absolutely sound.” His words have a dramatic effect as Gopal survives
					the attack. “All is well that ends well”.
