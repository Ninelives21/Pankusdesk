					This is an interesting story about a young twelve year old boy by name
					Arun studying in a boarding school. The boy is confident and
					independent and is not afraid to travel alone at midnight. He happened
					to meet a strange woman at the Railway station. He was suspicious of
					the woman initially but was comfortable with her after noticing her
					sadness, soft voice, kindness and concern for him. When Arun was on
					the platform with the strange woman his friend Satish and his mother
					arrived at the platform. Satish’s mother was a large, imposing woman.
					She remarked it was such a bother to wait for the train in the middle
					of the night and one couldn’t let children wait there alone as
					anything could happen to a boy at a big station. There were so many
					dishonest people in the world. She advised them to be careful with
					strangers. Satish’s mother looked sternly at Arun and advised him not
					to talk or be friendly with strangers when he was alone. Arun did not
					like his friend Satish’s mother who clearly thought that his mother
					and he came from a very poor family.

					take an interest in the kind woman. When he started talking about his
					school friends and his likes and dislikes she listened patiently. She
					was also confident that Arun could travel alone which made Arun feel
					proud. Arun was impressed with her gentle behaviour and her genuine
					concern for him, though she seemed poor. He liked the simplicity of
					her dress, her deep soft voice and the serenity of her face. Moreover
					in the course of their conversation, the lady told Satish’s mother
					that she was Arun’s mother. When Arun looked straight into the eyes of
					the woman she smiled in a gentle, understanding way. All these
					incidents made Arun call her ‘mother’.
