				Della finished crying. She went up to the looking-glass and began to
				powder her cheeks. Then she stood by the window and looked out dully at
				a grey cat walking on a grey fence in a grey backyard. Tomorrow would be
				Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present.
				She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result.
				Twenty dollars a week doesn’t go far. Expenses had been greater than she
				had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim.
				Oh, the many happy hours she had spent planning for something nice for
				him! Something fine and rare, worthy of the honour of being owned by
				Jim.

				Technology that is used in ISRO and NASA defence applications shines
				here atop the towers (gopurams) of
				<strong>Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple</strong>. The
				recently-reconstructed temple at <strong>Yadagirigutta</strong> has many
				unique features to its credit. One among them is the use of
				<strong>Nano Tech Gold Deposition (NTGD)</strong> technology. It went
				into the electroplating of gold onto the fifty-two intricately-designed
				Kalasams that adorn the gopurams. It replaced the conventional gold
				coating. It all began when the steely-nerved and iron-willed Kalvakunta
				Chandrasekhar Rao wanted the gold’s luster to last for fifty years.
				Gold-coated objects shine just for fifteen years. Things moved fast to
				materialise the big dream. The Chennai-based
				<strong>Smart Creations</strong> was assigned the job. They studied
				various technologies adopted in temples, masjids and other religious
				places around the globe. Finally, they chose this NTGD Technology. This
				method consumes less gold. The gold is hundred percent recoverable. And
				the glitter withstands the vagaries of weather and shines for decades!
				Sculptural innovations add value to the spiritual experience of the
				pilgrims who visit this hill temple!
			</p>

			<p>
				i) Name the technology used to electroplate gold onto the ‘Kalasams’ of
				the hill temple.

			<p>iv) Write three advantages of using NTGD technology.</p>
			<p>v) What does the expression ‘the big dream’ refer to?</p>
			<p>
				vi) Write the synonym of the word ‘luster’ that you find in the passage.
			</p>
			<p>vii) Name the presiding deity of this hill temple.</p>
			<p>viii) Write the part of speech of the word ‘unique’.</p>

			<p>
				Progress in life depends a good deal on crossing one threshold after
				another. Some time ago a man watched his little nephew trying to write
				his name. It was hard work, very hard work. The little boy had arrived
				at an effort to clear a threshold. Today he writes his name with
				comparative ease. Some people make the mistake of steering clear of
				thresholds. One man went into an entirely new business when he was past
				middle life and made a success of it. De Morgan didn’t start to write
				novels until he was past sixty. Psychologists have discovered that man
				can continue to learn throughout life. And it is undoubtedly better to
				try and fail, than not to try at all. Then, one can be placed in the
				category of the Swiss mountaineer of whom it was said, “He died
				climbing.” When a new difficulty raises to obstruct your path, do not
				complain. Accept the challenge. Determine to cross this threshold as you
				have crossed numerous other thresholds in your past life. In the words
				of the poet, do not rest but strive to pass from dream to dream.
