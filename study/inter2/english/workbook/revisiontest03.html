			<p><strong>Mother of Inventor</strong></p>

			<p>
				Necessity is the mother of invention. So goes the widely-accepted wise
				saying. Here, however, a mother’s toil for long hours brought out the
				inventor in Padma Shri Chintakindi Mallesham. Born into a poor weaver’s
				family in Sharajpet village near Alair, Dr. Mallesham dropped out of
				school after his 6th class. His mother, Lakshmi, used to work on a
				manual Asu (a pre-loom activity in the dye and weaving fashion). That
				tedious work (turning the threads around the Asu for 9000 times to get
				yarn ready for just one saree!) used to leave her shoulders and joints
				strained to extreme levels. Moved by his mother’s pain, Dr. Mallesham
				decided to find a way out. He moved heaven and earth for years. His
				determination was his sole resource. Challenges were many. Support from
				his wife, Swarna (literally ‘gold’!) and a few friends mattered a lot.
				Finally, in 1999, he made his dream come true. Mechanical Laxmi (his
				mother’s name) Asu saw the light of day. That filled many weaver homes
				with the light of relief from their toil. Accolades came his way.
				Governments, universities, NGOs honoured him. A biopic was made based on
				his achievements. Even Forbes listed him among the seven powerful rural
				entrepreneurs. Now he runs an Asu-making unit at Alair. He visits
				institutions inspiring the young with his simple, to-the-point and
				time-specific talks.
			</p>

			<p>i) What brought out the inventor in Dr. Mallesham?</p>
			<p>ii) Define how <em>Asu</em> works?</p>
			<p>
				iii) Describe the conditions in which Dr. Mallesham struggled to make
				his dream machine.
			</p>
			<p>
				iv) Does his invention help his mother alone? Support your answer with
				evidence from the passage.
			</p>
			<p>v) Name any two honours Dr. Mallesham received.</p>
			<p>
				vi) Find out the idiom used in the passage that means
				<em
					>did everything one could possibly do in order to achieve
					something</em
				>.
			</p>
			<p>
				vii) Pick out the one-word substitute from the passage that means
				<em
					>persons who start business especially when that involves taking
					financial risks</em
				>.
			</p>
			<p>
				viii) A <em>portmanteau</em> word is a word blending the sounds and
				combining the meaning of two words – Example: smoke + fog = smog. Now
				find out one such portmanteau word from the passage that blends
				<em>biography + picture</em>.
			</p>
