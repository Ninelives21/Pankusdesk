				<strong>
					4. Read the following passage and answer ANY FIVE questions given
					below:
				</strong>
				<span style="float: right">(5 × 1 = 5)</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				I asked for the office of the Dean, Dr. Lionel Loftus, F.R.C.P. A porter
				showed me into a small bare waiting room decorated only by framed
				black-and-white pictures of past deans, which ran along the walls like a
				row of dirty tiles. As there were no chairs, I sat on the edge of the
				dark polished table and swung my legs. The surroundings and a week of my
				father’s coaching had made me depressed and nervous. My mind was filled
				with the awkward questions that Dr. Loftus was even then contemplating
				asking me, and I found to my surprise I would give no satisfactory
				replies to any of them. I wondered what I should say if he simply asked
				me why I wanted to be a doctor. The answer was, I suppose, that neither
				my parents nor myself had the originality to think of anything else, but
				this didn’t seem a suggestion likely to help me into the medical school.

			<p><strong>Bird Lover of a Rare Kind</strong></p>

			<p>
				Penumaka Malakshmi (a man, please) of Kadium in East Godavari district
				is a daily wage earner from a downtrodden community. Yet, he has been
				feeding thousands of birds regularly for over six decades. He is now
				seventy-two and his service continues. He collects sheafs of paddy from
				farmers during the harvest time. He stores those paddy bundles in a
				nearby temple. Every evening, he picks up some ears of paddy (380) and
				weaves them into ornamental tassels and hangs them from buildings. Birds
				in flocks feed on them joyously. On New Year Days, he erects an arch
				near the temple and hangs some beautifully woven tassels from it.
				Thousands of chirping birds picking grains from that ornamental arch is
				a sight to behold! This rare act of real charity has seen the light of
				day as a national best teacher awardee, Mr. Chilukuri Srinivasa Rao
				(himself a lover of dogs and plants – feeds hundreds of stray dogs every
				day and planted over one lakh saplings so far!) has written about
				Malakshmi in <em>Prajasakthi</em> (January, 2021).
			</p>

			<p>i) How does Penumaka Malakshmi make his living?</p>
			<p>
				ii) How does Malakshmi find means to feed hundreds of birds every day?
			</p>
			<p>
				iii) What is his art that attracts people’s attention towards his
				charity?
			</p>
			<p>iv) How has Malakshmi’s rare act of charity come to light?</p>
			<p>
				v) Write the idiom used in the passage to mean
				<em>become publicly known</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				vi) Write the word used in the passage that forms a set of homophones
				with <em>site / cite</em>.
			</p>
			<p>vii) Find out the synonym from the passage of <em>see</em>.</p>

				<em>community</em>.
