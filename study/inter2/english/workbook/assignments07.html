			<p><strong>Bird Lover of a Rare Kind</strong></p>

			<p>
				Penumaka Malakshmi (a man, please) of Kadium in East Godavari district
				is a daily wage earner from a downtrodden community. Yet, he has been
				feeding thousands of birds regularly for over six decades. He is now
				seventy-two and his service continues. He collects sheafs of paddy from
				farmers during the harvest time. He stores those paddy bundles in a
				nearby temple. Every evening he picks up some years of paddy and weaves
				them into ornamental tassels and hangs them from buildings. Birds in
				flocks feed on them joyously. On New Year Days, he erects an arch near
				the temple and hangs some beautiful woven tassels from it. Thousands of
				chirping birds picking grains from that ornamental arch is a sight to
				behold! This rare act of real charity has seen the light of day as a
				national best teacher awardee, Mr Chilukuri Srinivas Rao (himself a
				lover of dogs and plants, feeds hundreds of stray dogs every day and
				planted over one lakh saplings so far!) has written about Malakshmi in
				Prajasakthi (January, 2021).

				charity?

			</p>
			<p>
				Even the smartest and most qualified job seekers need to prepare for job
				interviews. You do not get a second chance if you fail to impress the
				interview panel.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first nonverbal impression can be a great beginning — or quick
				ending — to your interview. One must demonstrate confidence. Standing
				straight and not slouching, making eye contact with the interviewers and
				connecting with a firm handshake are important physical gestures which
				are an index of your confidence. It is important, also, to be
				well-groomed and to wear formal clothes befitting the occasion. Casual
				clothes may be frowned upon.
			</p>
			<p>
				Good communication is not limited to verbal expression but includes
				listening skills too. The candidate should keenly observe the
				interviewers and speak only as much as he ought to. Prior to the
				interview the candidate should prepare himself by reading about the job
				requirements and about the company. He will then be in a better position
				to tailor his answers to the needs of the job. He should use language
				which is polite and respectful. Under no circumstances should personal
				comments and jokes based on race, gender, community or religion be made.
			</p>
			<p>
				Part of knowing how to interview is being ready to ask questions that
				demonstrate an interest in what goes on in the company. Asking questions
				also gives you the opportunity to find out if this is the right place
				for you
