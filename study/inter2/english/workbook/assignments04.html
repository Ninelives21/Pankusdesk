				She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else.
				There was no other like it in any of the stores. It was a platinum
				watch-chain, simple but well made. It was worthy of the watch. As soon
				as she saw it she decided that it was the right present for Jim. She
				paid twenty-one dollars for it and hurried home with the 87 cents that
				remained.

				“... ...
				<strong
					>Ramanujan’s heart was greater: He felt for the downtrodden</strong
				>
				... ...” asserted Swami Vivekananda. And Gosti Purna called
				<strong>Ramanujacharya Emperumanar</strong> (<em>emberuma:ner</em> – a
				Dravida word meaning superior to all of us). What made them describe
				Bhagvad Ramanujacharya thus? How noble Ramanujacharya must be to invite
				such appreciation! Yes, indeed He was! Regarded as a heavenly star
				descended down, he grew to be not only a spiritual giant but also an
				amazing social reformer. He saw divinity in living and inanimate beings.
				As an epitome of <strong>EQUALITY</strong>, He threw himself heart and
				soul into eliminating all barriers. He defied the then rigid customs. He
				allowed even the downtrodden into temples and to partake in temple
				services. More than that, He revamped the temple administration
				thoroughly. He was eager to learn from anyone at any cost. With
				unmatching perseverance, He walked 100 KMs to Gosti Pura eighteen times
				to receive the ‘esoteric’ mantra. He was equally committed to teach all.
				And, He revealed that sacred ‘mantra’ to everyone. He affirmed that hell
				would be fine for Him, if everyone got liberation. How supreme His
				sacrifice was! This legendary incarnation of learner, teacher and
				reformer (three-in-one) finds an astounding embodiment of His image and
				teachings as the gigantic
				<strong>216-foot golden-hued STATUE OF EQUALITY</strong> – courtesy the
				vision and commitment of His Holiness Tridandi Chinna Srimannarayana
				Ramanuja Jeeyar! Shall we assimilate the message? Follow it. Stay
				blessed. (216 words: 216-foot statue)
			</p>

			<p>
				i) How did Swami Vivekananda support his claim that Ramanuja’s heart was
				greater?
			</p>
			<p>
				ii) Quote the sentence from the passage that proves that Ramanuja’s
				heart was eager to learn at any cost.
			</p>
			<p>iii) Why did Ramanujacharya say that hell would be fine for Him?</p>
			<p>
				iv) What did Ramanujacharya do to permit all to offer services in
				temples?
			</p>
			<p>
				v) Write the synonym of the word <em>embodiment</em>. Find in the
				passage.
			</p>
			<p>
				vi) Pick out the idiom from the passage that means
				<em>with a lot of energy and enthusiasm.</em>

				vii) What is the antonym of <em>living</em> that you find in the
				passage?

			<p>
				viii) The STATUE OF EQUALITY seeks to inspire us to submit ourselves
				_______ to the service of our Acharya _______ to society and the Supreme
				Being.

				It was a matter of surprise to the outside world that independent India
				should have appointed women to the highest posts so freely, as members
				of the cabinet, as governors of provinces, as ambassadors and as leaders
				of delegations to international conferences, for in an oriental country
				such as India, women are presumed to be held in subjection and therefore
				all this seemed to be unnatural.

			<p style="margin-left: 20px">
				Many religions existed in India in the Middle Age. The most widely
				prevalent were, of course, Hinduism and Islam. But there were other
				religions too, like Buddhism, Jainism and Christianity. The outlook of
				the people, whether they were Hindus or Muslims, was the same. They
				believed that the world was a vale of sorrow, and the only way to escape
				from it and the attainment for true happiness were by turning their
				hearts away from temptations of the senses and taking refuge in complete
				surrender to the will of God whose unlimited grace alone could save man.
				It was, therefore, necessary to place oneself under the control of a
				spiritual guide and preceptor, and to follow the path of inner
				discipline which led to the goal of realization of God. Both among the
				Hindus and the Muslims, there were many orders that saintly preceptors
				had established. The heads of these orders ministered to the needs of
				their disciples. Kabir, Nanak and others among the Hindus had founded
				such orders.
