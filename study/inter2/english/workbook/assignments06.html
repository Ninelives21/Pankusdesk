					given after it in a word or in a sentence each.</strong
				><br />
				4 × 1 = 4M
			</p>

			<p>
				Jainism holds a distinct view about God. Mahavira’s belief in the
				individual is insuperable. He declares, unhesitatingly, that every
				individual (<strong>Atma</strong>) is the
				<strong>Supreme Being (Paramatma)</strong>. Mahavira attracts everyone’s
				admiration with his ability to destroy his own <strong>Karma</strong>,
				to know himself, and break free from the endless cycles of death and
				rebirth. Jain literature emphasises the need to examine
				<strong>Dharma</strong> critically. It also advises one to discover the
				hidden knowledge in oneself that is self-realization. When that happens,
				one realises that every creature is like oneself and one’s pain is
				other’s pain. That is what true <strong>Ahimsa</strong> is. They go to
				the extent of asserting that God is no more than man’s own higher self.
				What a unique belief! And Jains sincerely seek to reach that higher
				self!
			</p>

			<p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p>

			<p>i) What makes Jainism different from other faiths?</p>
			<p>ii) What did Mahavira believe in firmly?</p>
			<p>
				iii) What quality of Mahavira draws everyone’s admiration towards him?
			</p>
			<p>
				iv) Does one need to examine <strong>Dharma</strong> critically? Think
				of this critically, keeping in mind your views about Dharma.
			</p>
			<p>v) What do Jains say about God? Do you agree with them?</p>
			<p>
				vi) Mahavira’s trust in the individual is rather unshakeable. Does it do
				good to the individual? Explain in a sentence or two.
			</p>
			<p>
				vii) The word <strong>discover</strong> is a combination of
				<strong>dis</strong> (prefix) + <strong>cover</strong> (root). Analyse
				the word <strong>unhesitatingly</strong> in the same way.
			</p>
			<p>
				viii) Add one <strong>prefix</strong> and one or two
				<strong>suffixes</strong> to the root word <strong>believe</strong>.
			</p>

				General knowledge is the knowledge of every aspect of human life, which
				may or may not be a part of one's academic curriculum. There can be
				various areas identified as different domains of general knowledge like
				arts, discovery, games, politics, culture, films, medicine, history etc.
				The major branches can be classified as current affairs, fashion,
				family, physical health and recreation, arts and science.
			</p>

			<p>
				General knowledge helps us to grow both on a personal and academic
				level. General awareness increases our confidence. You could start a
				conversation with anybody on any topic and your knowledge would impress
				the person you are interacting with. General Knowledge also helps on the
				academic front. Almost all competitive exams thrive on general knowledge
				questions. Even the interview session that follows these exams consists
				of GK questions.
			</p>

			<p>
				General knowledge cannot be attained overnight. Reading newspapers and
				listening to news channels is an important practice that should be
				adopted. Another interesting medium to gain knowledge is through G.K.
				quizzes. Such quizzes are an entertaining way to attain knowledge of
				various subjects.
