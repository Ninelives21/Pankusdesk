				<strong>People who drafted our Constitution</strong>, also known as
				fathers of our constitution, did not intend that we just set up hovels,
				put students there, give untrained teachers, give them bad text books,
				no playgrounds and say we have complied with article 45. I dream to see
				students cultivate such a scientific spirit that they pursue their
				academics despite a Hindu V.C. is heading Aligarh Muslim University or a
				Muslim V.C. is administering Benares Hindu University. These are the
				views of
				<strong>Mohammadali Carim Chagla</strong> (30.9.1900–19.02.1982),
				expressed as the <strong>Union Education Minister</strong> (1963–1966).
				Look at the quality and equality he aimed at. Sixty years have passed
				since then. Yet, the wait continues.
				<strong>People like Chaglas are needed in multiples.</strong> He was a
				jurist, diplomat, minister with commitment to the cause of the country.
				Opposing the ideology of communal-based two nations, he broke ranks with
				his long-term associates. Education system needs such men to make it a
				man-making system!
			</p>

			<p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p>

			<p>
				i) About our education system, this passage expresses ________. Fill in
				the blank choosing from the list. <br />
				a) happiness &nbsp;&nbsp; b) anger &nbsp;&nbsp; c) satisfaction
				&nbsp;&nbsp; d) anguish
			</p>

			<p>
				ii) Are we complying with the provisions of our constitution regarding
				providing education? Support your answer with a sentence from the
				passage.
			</p>

			<p>
				iii) When can you say that students are cultivating the scientific
				spirit?
			</p>

			<p>
				iv) The views quoted in the passage were expressed sixty years ago. Are
				they relevant today? Provide proof from the passage that supports your
				answer.
			</p>

			<p>v) Why does education system need men like Chaglas?</p>

			<p>vi) What did Chagla do to oppose communal-based nations ideology?</p>

			<p>
				vii) Find out the <strong>idiom</strong> used in the passage that means
				<em>dissociated from.</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				viii) Write the <strong>one-word substitute</strong> used in the passage

				<strong>15. Read the following passage and make notes.</strong>
				<br />
				1 × 4 = 4M
			</p>

			<p><strong>Add a suitable Title.</strong></p>

			<p>
				Hobbies bring many benefits that usually make them more than worth the
				time they require. Popular hobbies include playing musical instruments,
				dance, sports and gardening.
			</p>

			<p>
				For those who aren’t overly stressed, and may actually be
				under-stimulated, hobbies provide a nice source of ‘eustress’, the
				healthy kind of stress that we all need to remain feeling excited about
				life. If the rest of your life is somewhat dull or uninspiring, hobbies
				can provide meaning and fun and can provide just the right amount of
				challenge.
			</p>

			<p>
				Many hobbies lend themselves to group activities: golfing, knitting and
				creative writing groups are good examples. Hobbies that connect you with
				others can bring the added benefit of social support which can bring
				meaning to life in a fun way. The friends you have fun with can become
				some of your best friends.
			</p>

			<p>
				Hobbies bring a sense of fun and freedom to life that can help to
				minimize the impact of chronic stress. Those who feel overwhelmed at a
				job, for example, can benefit from hobbies because they provide an
				outlet for stress and something to look forward to after a hard and
				stressful job. A study found that enjoyable activities performed during
				leisure time were associated with lower blood pressure and lower levels
				of depression.

				vi) canteen &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vii) suspect
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; viii) mother &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ix)
				authorize &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x) created

				<strong>
					17. Write a dialogue between a girl and her mother regarding
					discipline
