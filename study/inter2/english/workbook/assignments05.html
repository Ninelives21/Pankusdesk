					4. Read the following passage and answer ANY FOUR questions given

				4 × 1 = 4M
			</p>

			<p>
				When the doctor resumed his seat, the patient asked in the faintest
				whisper possible, “Is that someone crying?” The doctor advised, “Don’t
				exert yourself. You mustn’t talk.” He felt the pulse. It was already
				agitated by the exertion. The patient asked, “Am I going? Don’t hide it
				from me.” The doctor made a deprecating noise and sat back in his chair.
				He had never faced a situation like this. It was not in his nature to
				whitewash. People attached great value to his word because of that. He
				stole a look at the other. The patient motioned a finger to draw him
				nearer and whispered, “I must know how long I am going to last. I must
				sign the will. It is late already. Ask my wife for the dispatch box. You
				must sign as a witness.”
			</p>

			<p>i) Who was crying?</p>
			<p>ii) What was the doctor’s advice to Gopal?</p>
			<p>iii) Why was Gopal’s pulse already agitated?</p>
			<p>iv) “Am I going?” said Gopal. What did he mean by this?</p>
			<p>v) What was NOT there in the nature of the doctor?</p>

				vii) Write the <em>synonym</em>, from the passage, of the word

				“A combination of science and spirituality would bring peace to the
				world,” said Swami Vivekananda. With full faith in this dictum,
				<strong>MIT World Peace University, Pune</strong> has been organising
				annual editions of the
				<strong>World Parliament of Science, Religion and Philosophy.</strong>
				The unification of science, religion and philosophy is for the
				well-being of mankind, assert the organisers. On the eve of the
				inauguration of the three-day 8th edition of the World Parliament on
				April 3, 2022, MIT WPU, along with MIT Art, Design and Technology,
				celebrated the public dedication programme of the world’s biggest Peace
				Dome (certified by the <strong>World Book of Records, London</strong>).
			</p>

			<p>
				This Dome is regarded as a spiritually oriented scientific laboratory,
				showing the pathway of happiness, contentment and peace to the world. On
				this occasion, they distributed 1.25 lakh copies of the
				<strong>Shrimad Bhagavad Gita</strong>. Many believe the Gita as the
				“Book of Life” for entire humanity. Yet others consider it as the
				panacea. Prominent public persons, theologians of every major faith,
				philosophers, scientists, etc. participate in the annual editions of
				this
				<strong>World Parliament of Science, Religion and Philosophy.</strong>

				Vivekananda?

				of Science, Religion and Philosophy took up on April 3, 2022.

				iv) How often do the organisers conduct the World Parliament of Science,
				Religion and Philosophy?

				v) Who can participate in the World Parliament of Science, Religion and
				Philosophy?

				vi) Write the <em>one-word substitute</em> used in the passage that can
				replace <em>persons who study religion and beliefs</em>.

					situation.</em
