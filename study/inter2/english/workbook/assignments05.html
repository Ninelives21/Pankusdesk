			<p>
				When the doctor resumed his seat, the patient asked in the faintest
				whisper possible, “Is that someone crying?” The doctor advised, “Don’t
				exert yourself. You mustn’t talk.” He felt the pulse. It was already
				agitated by the exertion. The patient asked, “Am I going? Don’t hide it
				from me.” The doctor made a deprecating noise and sat back in his chair.
				He had never faced a situation like this. It was not in his nature to
				whitewash. People attached great value to his word because of that. He
				stole a look at the other. The patient motioned a finger to draw him
				nearer and whispered, “I must know how long I am going to last. I must
				sign the will. It is late already. Ask my wife for the dispatch box. You
				must sign as a witness.”

				“A combination of science and spirituality would bring peace to the
				world,” said Swami Vivekananda. With full faith in this dictum,
				<strong>MIT World Peace University, Pune</strong> has been organising
				annual editions of the
				<strong>World Parliament of Science, Religion and Philosophy.</strong>
				The unification of science, religion and philosophy is for the
				well-being of mankind, assert the organisers. On the eve of the
				inauguration of the three-day 8th edition of the World Parliament on
				April 3, 2022, MIT WPU, along with MIT Art, Design and Technology,
				celebrated the public dedication programme of the world’s biggest Peace
				Dome (certified by the <strong>World Book of Records, London</strong>).
			</p>

			<p>
				This Dome is regarded as a spiritually oriented scientific laboratory,
				showing the pathway of happiness, contentment and peace to the world. On
				this occasion, they distributed 1.25 lakh copies of the
				<strong>Shrimad Bhagavad Gita</strong>. Many believe the Gita as the
				“Book of Life” for entire humanity. Yet others consider it as the
				panacea. Prominent public persons, theologians of every major faith,
				philosophers, scientists, etc. participate in the annual editions of
				this
				<strong>World Parliament of Science, Religion and Philosophy.</strong>

				of Science, Religion and Philosophy took up on April 3, 2022.

					situation.</em

				Lizzie, a medical intern, arrived at the hospital promptly at 8.00 a.m.
				every morning. She said, “I began at once to prepare for the dressings
				by spreading the different ointments, preparing lint, lotion, poultices,
				bandages, etc. While I am doing that at a side table, the sister is
				going round and examining all wounds. The simpler cases she leaves
				entirely to me very often, but the more difficult ones, such as cancer,
				she dresses while I look on.” The time took varied constantly depending
				on the number and nature of the cases, but she generally had time to go
				upstairs and visit the patients in two medical wards before joining the
				house surgeon, Thomas, in his eleven o’clock round. After the doctor and
				surgeon finished their rounds, Lizzie gave patients their medicines as
				prescribed. Lunch was a fortifying meal of mutton chops and ale, which
				Lizzie ate alone in the hospital canteen. At 1.00 p.m., she returned to
				the surgical ward to accompany any visiting surgeons. Lizzie arrived
				back at home by 4.30, where she rested for half an hour, talking to
				Louie and James and playing with their children. After changing her
				clothes into something more dainty, she did algebra till teatime at
				seven o’clock. To close out her day, she wrote letters to friends and
				family by the fire or practised Latin.
