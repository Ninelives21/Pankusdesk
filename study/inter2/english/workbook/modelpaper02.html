				Pencil seems to be little but teaches SIX great lessons of life.
				Surprising? See how? (i) The pencil suffers a little when we use a
				sharpener but afterwards, it is much sharper. So, let’s learn to bear
				certain pains and sorrows because they will make us better persons. (ii)
				It allows us to use an eraser to rub out mistakes. This means correcting
				something we did is not necessarily a bad thing; it helps us to keep on
				the right path. (iii) What really matters in it is not its wooden
				exterior, but the graphite inside. So, let’s always pay attention to
				what is happening inside us. (iv) It always leaves a mark. In just the
				same way, everything we do in life will leave a mark. (v) It gets
				shorter and shorter with use. So does life. Let’s make the most of it
				while it lasts. (vi) It writes till the end. Let’s try to be useful and
				productive till the end.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
			<p>i) We stop writing with a pencil now and then. Why?</p>
			<p>ii) What is the result of bearing pains and sorrows?</p>
			<p>iii) Is correcting something we did a bad thing?</p>
			<p>iv) What matters most in a pencil?</p>
			<p>v) Why should we be conscious of every action of ours?</p>
			<p>vi) We use the pencil till the end. Write true or false.</p>

				In December 2019, the novel Corona Virus called SARS-COV-2 had resulted
				in a respiratory illness called COVID-19. ‘CO’ stands for Corona, ‘VI’
				for Virus, ‘D’ stands for Disease ‘19’ is the year in which it broke
				out. This virus was unknown before its outbreak in Wuhan in China, in
				December 2019. Corona Virus is a family of viruses that may cause
				disease in animals and humans. It causes respiratory infections ranging
				from the common cold to more severe diseases. India has approved seven
				vaccines. It’s currently using only three Vaccines — Covishield, Covaxin
				prepared by Bharath Biotech, and Sputnik V. While we are still learning
				how COVID-19 affects people, people with pre-existing medical conditions
				like high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer etc.,
				appear to bear greater risk than others.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can reduce the chances of being infected with COVID-19 by taking
				simple precautions. We should clean our hands with sanitiser or wash
				them with soap water, because this action kills viruses on our hands.
				Everyone must maintain 6 feet distance from others. Once contaminated,
				hands can transfer the viruses to your eyes, nose or mouth, so avoid
				touching eyes, nose and mouth. Droplets of saliva spread the virus. So,
				the distance needs to be maintained. Good respiratory hygiene protects
				the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu, and COVID-19.
				Therefore, masks need to be worn.
