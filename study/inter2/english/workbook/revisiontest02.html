				Learning there is pure fun. Life skills form the core of the curriculum.
				Lessons are drawn from the book of the world, not just from the world of
				academic books. Field visits are a regular feature. Educational tours
				are annual events. Gardening is a hobby. In vast playgrounds, they
				discuss physics principles. Classrooms get converted into playfields.
				The day dawns with games and physical activities. Reading newspapers is
				followed by Satsang discussions. Letter writing, story writing, book
				reviews, stage performance, songs, dances, drawing etc. are quite common
				activities here. Quizzes top them all. Prizes won in national and state
				level competitions number in hundreds. Everyone associated with this
				school was on cloud nine when an eighth-grade girl by name Namrutha
				watched Chandrayaan live along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 6
				September, 2019 from ISRO, Bengaluru. That fun-filled school is
				<em>Teja Vidyalaya</em>, at Kodada, a true temple of learning; and
				surprisingly, a temple has now come up beside it! The inspiration, they
				say, is Rishi Valley of Jiddu Krishna Murthy. And the school lives up to
				the inspiration!
			</p>

			<p>
				ii) Name the <strong>regular feature</strong> followed at this school.

				<em>extremely happy</em>.
