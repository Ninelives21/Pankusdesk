			<p><strong>Whom to Salute?</strong></p>

				When Dr. Abdul Kalam was the President, he visited Field Marshall Sam
				Manekshaw, who was ailing in the Military Hospital, Coonoor. He enquired
				about Sam’s health and asked, before leaving, whether he had any
				grievance. Sam replied that his only grievance was he wasn’t able to
				stand up and salute his most respected President. Kalam held Sam’s hands
				as both were in tears. Actually, Sam didn’t tell Kalam that he had not
				been paid the pension of Field Marshall’s rank till then, for nearly
				twenty years. However, Kalam came to know about it and passed the
				pension with arrears within a week and sent the cheque of nearly Rs.
				1.25 crores to Sam through the Defence Secretary by a special plane.
				That is the greatness of APJ. But then, Sam received the cheque and
				promptly donated it to the Army Relief Fund. Who will you salute now?

				The brain has three main divisions, each having its own particular
				function. The cerebrum is the largest and best-developed section of the
				brain. It is made up of many areas containing cells that control various
				parts of the body. Some areas perform the function of directing muscular
				activity. They allow the head to be turned, for example; other areas are
				responsible for sight, hearing, and speech.
			</p>

			<p>
				The cerebrum is also the centre of intelligence and it enables human
				beings to reason and remember. The cerebellum is a small section of the
				brain below the cerebrum; its function is to coordinate the movement of
				limbs and also to control balance. The medulla oblongata is an enlarged
				area that connects the brain to the spinal cord. It serves to regulate
				the activities of involuntary muscles.
			</p>

			<p>
				The parts of the brain are highly specialized. Together they make up the
				complex organ that controls the nervous system.
