			<p>
				As it approached, the boy jumped off the platform and ran across the
				tracks to the next platform. He was at a safe distance from the train
				and there was no danger unless he had fallen. But as he leapt across the
				tracks, the woman with me gripped my arm. Her fingers dug into my flesh
				painfully. I looked up at her. Her face was filled with pain and fear,
				and then sadness swept over her eyes. She watched the boy until he
				disappeared in the crowd and only then she relaxed her hold on my arm.
				She smiled at me, took my hand again, but her fingers trembled against
				mine.
			</p>

			<p>“He was all right,” I said, feeling that she needed reassurance.</p>

				The title sounds strange but the people who visit the
				<strong>Ramappa Temple</strong> and see the statues there can feel the
				<strong>Monumental Dance</strong> and affirm that it is not an
				exaggeration. The temple is located at Palampet, a village 70 km from
				Warangal in Telangana. The presiding deity is
				<strong>Lord Ramalingeshwara Swamy</strong> but it is named after the
				sculptor Ramappa who gave the structural form to the dance patterns
				recorded in the book <strong>Nritiya Rathnavali</strong>, written by
				<strong>Jayapa Senani</strong>, a military commander. Built by
				<strong>Kakatiya Ganapathi Deva</strong> in 1213 AD, it features
				construction techniques unique to the Kakatiya dynasty i.e., Sand Box
				technique, Granite Beams and Pillars,
				<strong>Vimana Gopuram</strong> etc. On 25th July 2021, the temple, the
				first from the Telugu states, was recognised by the UNESCO as a
				<strong>World Heritage Site</strong>. With this recognition its majesty
				and grandeur have become known worldwide, a moment of pride for all
				Telugu people.

			<p>
				It is observed that most educational institutions believe online classes
				as the only solution during this pandemic. In contrast, researcher Eric
				Bettinger Susanna Leob’s work
				<em>Promises and Pitfalls of Online Education</em> shows that online
				teaching may raise dropouts at primary and upper primary levels.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is observed from the survey report that online classes are suitable
				for classes 8 and above. It is beneficial to the one who can afford, but
				detrimental to the one who cannot afford it. This reflects adversely for
				primary classes. Most of the rural and BPL parents may not afford mobile
				phones, network charges, computers and even TV sets. This may lead to
				discrimination. Parents are not educated on cyber security and it may
				create a mess for parents as well as students. Our education system
				exists on the same planet as we are and is affected by the conditions
				around us as we are. Primary victims of online classes are rural
				students, particularly in the public sector. Most of the government
				school students from rural and interior areas can neither afford
				technology nor have parental support. It is the misfortune of these
				innocent kids. The system has to be considerate to them.
