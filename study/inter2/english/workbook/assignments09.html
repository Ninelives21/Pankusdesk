			<p>
				“I’m not the Dean,” he explained. “I am the medical school Secretary. I
				was Secretary here long before you were born, my boy. Before your
				father, probably. I remember well enough when the Dean himself came up
				to be admitted.” He removed his glasses and pointed them at me. “I’ve
				seen thousands of students pass through the school. Some of them have
				turned out good, and some of them bad — it’s just like your own
				children.”
			</p>

			<p>
				I nodded heartily, as I was anxious to please everyone. “Now, young
				feller,” he went on more briskly, “I’ve got some questions to ask you.”
				I folded my hands submissively and braced myself mentally.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Have you been to a public school?” he asked. “Yes.” <br />
				“Do you play Rugby football or Association?” “Rugby.” <br />
				“Do you think you can afford to pay the fees?” “Yes.” <br />
			</p>

			<p>
				He grunted, and without a word withdrew. Left alone, I diverted my
				apprehensive mind by running my eye carefully over the line of
				black-and-white pictures of past deans, studying each one in turn. After
				ten minutes or so the old man returned and led me in to see the living
				holder of the office.
			</p>

			<p>
				i) “I am not the Dean,” he explained. Who does the word ‘I’ refer to?
			</p>
			<p>ii) How long was the Secretary there in the college?</p>
			<p>iii) Name the games mentioned in the passage.</p>
			<p>iv) What was the last question to the speaker?</p>
			<p>v) How did the narrator divert his apprehensive mind?</p>

			<p>

				<em>have enough money to pay.</em>
			</p>
			<p>viii) Pick the antonym of <em>slowly</em> from the passage.</p>

				</strong>
				<br />
				4 × 1 = 4M

				A seventy-acre, man-made forest near Suryapet has exclusively and
				entirely been dedicated to the wild. An amazingly incredible spirit of
				an agricultural graduate,
				<strong>Mr. Dussarla Satyanarayana of Raghavapuram</strong>, near Motey
				(Suryapet district) made this a reality and possibility. Birds and
				animals of hundreds of types have homes in this haven. The nature-lover
				behind this project took all measures to make this expanse a sanctuary.
				Every product of this forest goes to feed ants and not a grain from here
				goes out for human consumption. Even the fallen trees feed white ants or
				get bio-degraded. Seven tanks dug here and there meet their water needs.
				The missionary zeal in him keeps him off the beaten track. He thanks his
				friends who happily share expenses. <strong>BBC Telugu</strong> telecast
				a ten-minute video of his mission. May his tribe multiply!
			</p>

			<p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p>

			<p>
				i) What is the special feature of this forest as highlighted in the
				title?
			</p>
			<p>ii) Who created this amazingly incredible wonder?</p>
			<p>iii) Where is that man-made forest?</p>
			<p>iv) How do his friends help this nature-lover?</p>
			<p>
				v) Write the <em>synonym</em>, from the passage, of the word
				<em>unbelievable</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
				vi) Pick out from the passage the one-word substitute that means
				<em>an area where wild birds and animals are protected.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				vii) Find out the <em>idiom</em> used in the passage to mean
				<em>far away from other people, houses, etc.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				viii) Mark <em>stress</em> on the right <em>syllable</em> of the word
				<strong>missionary</strong>.

				It is not enough to prepare well for examinations. Success in the exams
				depends also on your mental state of mind during the exam, proper time
				management, neat presentation of answers and other small details. Sleep
				well on the night before the exam and resist the temptation of
				last-minute cramming. You should be well rested and relaxed.
			</p>

			<p>
				On the morning of the exam, have a light breakfast and set out. Reach
				the examination hall well in time, particularly on the first day. Once
				you get the question paper, read it carefully. Remain calm—any silly
				mistake you may make in understanding the questions can have damaging
				consequences. Spend at least five minutes going through the different
				sections of the paper. It is advisable to start with those questions you
				are confident with, instead of wasting time with the difficult ones. Do
				not panic if you get stuck with a question. Leave it incomplete and move
				on to the next level of difficulty. Save the toughest questions for the
				end. All the ‘bits’ pertaining to a question should be answered in a
				sequence and at one place. Keep numbering the papers as you proceed.
				Draw all diagrams neatly and colour them, if possible, to make them more
				attractive. After you complete the paper, tie up the sheets properly.
				You should then revise the answer paper at least twice before handing it
				in.
