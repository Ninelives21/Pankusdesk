			<p>
				She took me into the station dining room and ordered tea, samosas, and
				jalebies. At once I began to relax and take an interest in this kind
				woman. The strange meeting with her had little effect on my appetite. I
				was a hungry schoolboy. I ate as much as I could without being impolite.
				She took pleasure in watching me and eat. I think the food strengthened
				our friendship, for under the influence of the tea and sweets I began to
				talk quite freely. I told her about my school, my friends, my likes and
				dislikes. She questioned me quietly from time to time, but preferred
				listening.
			</p>

			<p>i) Who is ‘she’ referred to in this passage?</p>
			<p>ii) Where did she take the boy?</p>
			<p>iii) What did she order for him?</p>

				<li>I ate not much food without being polite.</li>
				<li>I ate sufficient quantity of food without being shy.</li>
				<li>I ate scanty food with a feeling of fear.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>vi) What did he think of the food offered by the woman?</p>

				Inscriptions are writings on hard surfaces like stones or metals. In
				olden days, Kings used to record important information in the form of
				inscriptions. One such inscription of
				<strong>Tribhuvanamalla Vikramaditya VI</strong> (1076–1127 AD) of
				Western Chalukya Kings at <strong>Guduru</strong> of Palakurthy Mandal,
				Jangaon District bears a date in the cyclic year Krodhin, equated with
				the 49<sup>th</sup> year 1124 AD. The script on the inscription has the
				poetic stanzas in <strong>Kannada</strong> on three sides and in
				<strong>Telugu</strong> on the fourth side. It gives a genealogical
				account of the Chiefs of the <strong>Viriyala Family</strong>. It also
				records the endowment of the village <strong>Bammera</strong>, the birth
				place of Pothana, by Viriyala Malla. Pothana (1450–1510), a great
				scholar of Telugu and Sanskrit, rendered
				<strong>Sri Andhra Maha Bhagavatham</strong> into Telugu.
				<strong>Palakurthy</strong>, the Mandal headquarter, is also famous as
				the birth place of <strong>Palkuriki Somanatha</strong>, one of the most
				popular Telugu poets of the 13<sup>th</sup> century.
