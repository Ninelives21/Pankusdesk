				He frowned at his paper pad for a few seconds. His face suddenly
				lightened, and I saw he had come to a decision. My hands gripped the
				arms of the chair as I waited to receive it. Rising, he shook me briskly
				by the hands and told me he had pleasure in admitting me to St
				Swithin’s.
			</p>

			<p>
				I wondered for some time afterwards how he had been able to discover
				from these questions that I had the attributes of a successful doctor,
				but I later found that even this brief interview was superfluous, as the
				Dean always took the advice of his old secretary and told applicants
				whose looks this man disliked that there were no vacancies.

			<p>
				<strong>Ananda Nilayam</strong> (Delight’s Dwelling / Home of
				Happiness)! The name speaks volumes about the place. Situated at
				Kondapaka (Siddipet district), two hundred metres off Hyderabad–Siddipet
				road, on a one-hundred-acre site, the place mainly serves the old (now
				forty inmates) with no emotional support from their children. Even
				orphaned children (now numbering around fifty) are provided shelter,
				care, and education. What looked like dry barren land with scattered
				bushes before 2010 is now a tastefully landscaped garden. Chirping
				birds, dancing twigs, fragrant flowers greet the visitors and the
				inmates.
			</p>

			<p>
				A teacher from Siddipet, Mr. Peddi Vaikuntam, along with other trustees
				and with advice and active help from a good number of elders and
				well-wishers, initiated the process and has been carrying on the mission
				with success rates beyond expectation. An industrialist from Karnataka,
				Ms. Sudha Janardan, contributed Rs. Fifty Lakhs to this project. Charity
				from rice millers of Siddipet and Hotel Suprabhath of Hyderabad helps
				the trust provide food, medical services, etc. to the inmates at a
				nominal charge. The trust has been serving gods, humans, and nature with
				beauty, quality, and equality. Each face here reflects the name of the
				place!
			</p>

			<p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p>

			<p>
				i) Does the name of this Old Age Home indicate the mood and response of
				the inmates? Support your answer with a sentence from the passage.

			<p>ii) Where is this Home for the Aged located?</p>
			<p>
				iii) Who initiated the project and who has been actively monitoring all

				v) Name the donor from a neighbouring state and the sum donated by her.

			<p>
				vi) Write the word used in the passage that means
				<em>kindness, support, or money extended to people in need.</em>

			<p>
				vii) Find out the phrasal verb used in the passage to mean
				<em>continuing with the work and taking it forward.</em>
			</p>

				“Thanks to the internet, women can become entrepreneurs. In the last

				Ankhi. “Kalpana Rajesh, a woman from India, was inspired to start her
				own business making bridal hair accessories after having done so for
				years for friends. She started her business in 2012 with three people –
				herself, her domestic worker and her friend. Today, she employs more
				than 200 women, working across thirty-six branches from Delhi to
				Tuticorin, with multiple product lines. She says that without Facebook,
				she estimates it would have taken her fifteen to twenty years to grow
				her business to the same size it is today. Not only has Kalpana made a
				difference to her own life, but she has also made a telling difference
				to the lives of more than 200 women who are now earning their
				livelihood, thanks to Kalpana.”
