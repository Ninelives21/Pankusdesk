					Women in ancient India enjoyed an enviable position. But their status
					in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries touched its lowest point.
					K.M. Panikkar enumerates the factors that contributed to this fall.
					Women in those days were isolated from the mainstream. They were kept
					behind the ‘purdah’. They were denied education. Child marriages were
					the order. Once married, women were subjected to many more
					restrictions. Early maternity, high mortality rates among men, and the
					resulting widowhood added to women’s woes. All these causes
					collectively condemned women to a pathetically low condition. The
					awakening of women from that pitiable position began with the Gandhian
					movement—and it continues!

					Women in ancient India enjoyed a high status but during the 18th and
					19th centuries, their position degraded to a pitiable condition. Women
					were secluded from the mainstream. They were kept behind the ‘purdah’,
					denied education, and subjected to many atrocities. However, Gandhiji
					had immense faith in the untapped power of womanhood in India.
					Originally, he was uncertain of the response and their role in the
					national movement. But, when the movement actually started, they were
					involved in every aspect — picketing liquor shops, enforcing boycotts
					of foreign clothes, and undertaking civil disobedience. They played a
					prominent role. Women all over India defied all social taboos,
					sacrificed physical comforts, and were everywhere at the forefront.
					Their active participation made a significant impact. Gandhiji hailed
					them as the main support of this movement.

					The distinction achieved by a few women of genius cannot be an
					indicator of the changed position of women in India. What is really
					significant is a revolutionary change in their free and equal
					participation in spheres of national activity and at every level—from
					villages to government. The ancient tradition emphasized their
					equality, but in later years, their freedom was restricted due to
					social bondages. During the twentieth century, the position of women
					gradually improved. Gandhiji’s non-cooperation movement witnessed
					active participation of women. The contribution of women to modern
					India has forced the creation of a new code of laws establishing
					equality of women. The appointment of women to the highest posts—as
					members of the cabinet, as ambassadors, and as leaders of delegations
					to several high positions—is a testimony to the empowerment of women
					in India.

					Awakening of women in India from a pitiable position imposed by social
					bondages and conservatism began with the Gandhian movement. The
					contribution of women in the national movement led to the realization
					of their untapped potential. The governing bodies were forced to
					create a new code of laws and legislative reforms to establish the
					equality of women. This has been one of the most significant political
					achievements in the period of partial self-government. Women were
					granted rights to independent property, freedom of marriage, right to
					education, and employment. The raising of the age of consent for
					marriage and prevention of the dedication of women to temple services
					helped to change their status. These significant reforms were the
					reflection of the general awakening of women in India.
