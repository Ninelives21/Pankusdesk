		<h2>Prose: Guilty (One-Act Play)</h2>
		<h3>By Horace Gardiner and Bonneviere Arnaud</h3>
		<h3>Question and Answers</h3>
		<p><em>Answer the following questions in 100 words each.</em></p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong
					>Describe the importance of Mrs. Moore’s role in ‘Guilty’.</strong
				><br />
				<p>
					The delightful one-act play, ‘Guilty’ authored by Horace Gardiner and
					Bonneviere Arnaud, is didactic and imparts moral instruction
					indirectly. People consider Horace and Arnaud as a single author for
					the apparent reason of the non-availability of any literary work by
					them individually. Horace Gardiner is a well known essayist, literary
					critic and a university professor while Bonneviere Arnaud had 176
					library holdings to his credit.
				</p>
				<p>
					The play ‘Guilty’ is a fascinating one-act play which is humorous as
					well as expressive. Mrs. Moore contributes a good part to this
					didactic element. As such her part in the play is significant. She is
					the first to appear in the play, symbolizing her importance. She talks
					about dignity of labour forcefully. She also emphasizes the fact that
					all kinds of jobs need good employees. Mrs. Moore stresses the need on
					the part of the employees to be loyal to their employers. She,
					however, has her own share of flaws. Her comment that she is glad that
					she has no sons, speaks of her bad taste. She pretends to know
					everything and seems to sympathies with others. Thus, she serves as a
					model – “How Not To Be”. Her report about the robbery sets the tone of
					the play and carries it forward in the right direction.

					>Ma Aryan puts what she thinks is two and two together and makes four
					out of it. Discuss the developments that lead (or, rather mislead) Ma
					Ryan into making this mistake.</strong

					Ma Ryan is the mother of the lead character in the play, Jim Ryan. Jim
					works as a night watchman at the Van King Warehouse though he is an
					engineering graduate for want of a better job. One morning, soon after
					Jim leaves the warehouse, a robbery takes place in which a diamond
					pendant is stolen from the office safe of the warehouse. In a dramatic
					turn of events he finds it at a lunch car on his way home and carries
					it in the pocket of his sweater. Ma Ryan who finds it in his pocket,
					puts two and two together and makes four out of it i.e. she takes it
					for granted that her son must have stolen the article from the
					warehouse. But as the story progresses it dawns on her that her son,
					in fact, found it at a lunch car on his way home and he has decided to
					give it back to its rightful owner. Thus, Ma Ryan’s putting two and
					two together and making four out of it misleads her by making her
					suspect her son.

					The delightful one-act play ‘Guilty’ is humorous and didactic to the
					core. Ma Ryan is the mother of the lead character, Jim in the play.
					Jim works as a night watchman at the Van King Warehouse though he is
					an engineering graduate, for want of a better job. One evening their
					neighbor Mrs. Moore shows her a newspaper report about the robbery of
					a diamond pendant at the Van King’s Warehouse along with its picture.
					At the same time Mrs. Ryan happens to find the same, the very same
					jewel in Jim’s pocket. Without a second thought Ma Ryan puts two and
					two together and makes four out of it i.e. she misunderstands her son
					to be a thief. But the fact remains that Jim finds it at a lunch car
					on his way home and carries home the same putting it in the pocket of
					his sweater. Thus Jim is proved to be innocent and loyal to his
					employer, and is rightly rewarded for his honesty.

					Mr. Van King, its owner to his house to hand it over to him, if it
					happens to be the same article. But by then Jim’s mother finds it in
					the pocket of his sweater. It looks the same as she has seen in the
					newspaper. So she reaches the conclusion that Jim must have been
					involved in the theft of the diamond and instructs her son to hand it
					over to Mr. Van King, its owner. At the same time, she warns her son
					to escape or the police will put him in jail. Jim is puzzled at her
					odd behaviour and concludes that she is talking like someone in a fog
					without any sense. These words spoken by Jim are not to be taken
					seriously as his mother is not aware of the reality of the situation.
