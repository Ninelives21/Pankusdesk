		<h2>Prose: How to Avoid Foolish Opinions</h2>
		<h3>By Bertrand Russell</h3>
		<h3>Question and Answers</h3>
		<p><em>Answer the following questions in about 100 words each.</em></p>

				<strong
					>How can we prevent developing a dogmatic attitude as per Russell’s
					suggestion?</strong
				><br />
				<p>
					The essay “How to Avoid Foolish Opinions” was written by Bertrand
					Russell. He was a multifaceted personality. He was an advocate for
					reason and rational attitude.
				</p>
				<p>
					Russell says that there are several ways to avoid being dogmatic. The
					first way is making a keen observation so as to get rid of the bias.
					Hence, to know what other people think, one has to be aware of what
					they think. This can be done by going on a vacation and talking to
					people with different ideas. If we cannot travel, we have to seek out
					people with whom we disagree or read a newspaper with a contrary
					opinion. The third is arguing with an imaginary character who has a
					different point of view. The fourth one is to deal with one’s sense of
					self-worth, which is the hardest. To overcome conceit, we must
					remember that we live for a short while on a small planet in a vast
					cosmos.

					The essay “How to Avoid Foolish Opinions” was written by Bertrand
					Russell. He was a multifaceted personality. He was an advocate for
					reason and rational attitude.

				<p>
					According to Russell, travelling is profitable in diminishing the
					narrow-minded viewpoint. He cautions the readers that we may remain
					biased in our opinion if we are unaware of different opinions. Russell
					says when he was young, he travelled to different countries like
					France, Germany, Italy, and the United States. He found it profitable
					to reduce his narrow-minded view. He advises us, if we cannot travel,
					we have to seek out people with whom we disagree and read a newspaper
					that belongs to our opponents. If the people and the newspaper seem
					mad or wicked, remind yourself that you seem so to them. He opines
					that both parties may be right, but both cannot be wrong.

					>According to Russell, what is the only way to tackle
					self-pride?</strong
				><br />
				<p>
					The essay “How to Avoid Foolish Opinions” was written by Bertrand
					Russell. He was a multifaceted personality. He was an advocate for
					reason and rational attitude.
				</p>
				<p>
					Russell warns us to be wary of opinions that flatter our self
					confidence. We see both men and women who are firmly convinced of the
					superiority of their own gender. If you are a man, you point out that
					most poets and men of science are male. If you are a woman, you retort
					to say that most men are criminals. We also set a standard of values
					for our own nation to prove it is superior to other nations. The
					question is insoluble. But our self-pride conceals this fact from most
					people. It is more difficult to deal with the self-esteem of man as a
					man because one cannot argue out the matter with some non-human mind.
					To overcome this human conceit, we must remember we live for a short
					time on a small planet in a vast cosmos.

					>What does Bertrand Russell say about a person getting angry about a
					difference of opinion?</strong
				><br />
				<p>
					The essay “How to Avoid Foolish Opinions” was written by Bertrand
					Russell, an English writer. This is a thought-provoking essay which
					reveals intense human interest.
				</p>
				<p>
					Russell admits that if an opinion contrary to your own makes you
					angry, it means you are subconsciously aware of having no good reason
					for thinking as you do. If someone says that two and two are five or
					that Iceland is on the equator, you feel pity rather than anger unless
					you know so little of Arithmetic or Geography that his opinion shakes
					your own contrary conviction. The most prevalent controversies are
					those about matters where there is no good evidence either way. Hence,
					Russell advises us to be on our guard when we come across a difference
					of opinion because, on examination, we find that our belief is going
					beyond evidence.
