		<h2>Prose: Solution to Plastic Pollution (Internet)</h2>
		<h3>By Dr. Rajagopalan Vasudevan</h3>
		<h3>Question and Answers</h3>
		<p><em>Answer the following questions in about 100 words each.</em></p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong
					>Describe the deportment of Dr. Vasudevan as the Professor of
					TCE.</strong
				><br />
				<p>
					Dr. Rajagopalan Vasudevan was born in Tamil Nadu. After receiving his
					doctorate in Science in 1974, he joined TCE as a member of the
					faculty. From then on, he dedicated his research to the management of
					plastic waste. “Solution to Plastic Pollution” is about his research
					project. Dr. Vasudevan was a Professor at Thiagarajar College of
					Engineering. Though he was a Professor of Chemistry, his deportment
					seemed like that of a Sanskrit Pandit. He is popularly known as
					Madurai’s “Plastic Road Man”.
				</p>
				<p>
					Always sporting a striking namam on his forehead, he was as much at
					ease when he experimented with chemicals in the science lab as when he
					held beakers over flames under a peepul tree while talking with a
					group of students at lunch break, teaching them shlokas from the
					Bhagavad Gita. He could easily be mistaken for a Sanskrit pandit if
					you heard him quote the holy text as a solution to any problem in the
					world. Mesmerized students listened to him in rapt attention. He
					considered the Gita a manual for leading life and voluntarily
					conducted classes uninterrupted for 36 years. He maintained a low
					profile. He was a man with a mission and “Clean India” was his
					campaign.

					>How did Dr. Vasudevan experiment with plastic waste and what has been
					the result?</strong

					doctorate in Science in 1974, he joined TCE as a member of the
					faculty. From then on, he dedicated his research to the management of
					plastic waste. “Solution to Plastic Pollution” is about his research

				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Vasudevan developed a very simple but effective technology. He
					transformed plastic waste into a material that replaced a small
					portion of bitumen used in road construction. Garbage dumps are the
					inexhaustible sources for this innovation. Dr. Vasudevan tells us how
					he adds value to waste by using it in laying all-weather roads. After
					the city’s rain-fed potholes transitioned to smooth roads within the
					campus of TCE, it was indeed a treat. No wonder he is known as
					Madurai’s “Plastic Road Man”. His interest in the subject began when
					he heard an erroneous remark that plastic dissolved in water. He
					started mixing some waste plastic in heated bitumen, and the rest is
					history. His innovation serves the twin purpose of increasing road
					quality and solving the problem of plastic disposal.

					>How did A.P.J. Abdul Kalam encourage Dr. Vasudevan and what has been
					the outcome?</strong

				</p>
				<p>
					He faced many hurdles while doing research on plastic waste. While on
					his work, once A.P.J. Abdul Kalam visited the college. Dr. Vasudevan
					presented to Kalam his project and its potential use as a coating over
					the pebbles for laying roads. Kalam told Dr. Vasudevan that one day
					his test would become the convention. He encouraged him to continue
					his work without being discouraged by drawbacks. Kalam’s words proved
					prophetic, and Dr. Vasudevan laid the first 60-foot-long plastic road
					within the college campus.

					>List the advantages of plastic roads as described by Dr.
					Vasudevan.</strong
				><br />
				<p>
					Dr. Rajagopalan Vasudevan was born in Tamil Nadu. After receiving his
					doctorate in Science in 1974, he joined TCE as a member of the
					faculty. From then on, he dedicated his research to the management of
					plastic waste. “Solution to Plastic Pollution” is about his research

					seemed like that of a Sanskrit Pandit. He is popularly known as
					Madurai’s “Plastic Road Man”.
				</p>
				<p>
					Dr. Rajagopalan Vasudevan’s innovation has many advantages. To lay one
					kilometer of plastic road 3.75 meters wide, one tonne of bitumen and
					one tonne of waste plastic are required. A normal road requires ten
					tonnes of bitumen for each kilometer. Hence, a plastic road reduces
					the cost involved and saves one tonne of bitumen for every kilometer
					laid. Any form of plastic waste can be shredded and used.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other benefits are zero maintenance, simple technology, spot use
					of plastic waste, and waterproof roads that can last up to 100 years.
					They also have higher load-carrying capacity, double the road
					strength, and a new surface without cracks and potholes. The list is
					endless. Hats off to this simple man who understood how and where his
					knowledge could be implemented.
