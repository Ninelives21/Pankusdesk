			<h2>ATOMIC STRUCTURE - THINGS TO REMEMBER</h2>

			<h4>Constants</h4>
			<ol class="outer-list">
				<li>
					<ol class="inner-list">
						<li>
							The mass of a single electron is approximately \(9.109 \times
							10^{-31}\) kg.
						</li>
						<li>
							Avogadro's number, which is the number of particles in one mole of
							a substance, is approximately \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\).
						</li>
						<li>Planck's constant (h) is \(6.626 \times 10^{-34}\) J·s.</li>
						<li>
							1 electron volt (eV) is equal to \(1.602 \times 10^{-19}\) J.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Formulae</h4>
			<ol class="outer-list">
				<li>
					<ol class="inner-list">
						<li>Isoneutronic nuclides have the same number of neutrons.</li>
						<li>
							The speed of light (\(c\)) is \(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\).
						</li>
						<li>
							The wavelength (\(\lambda\)) is often given in nanometers (nm) and
							must be converted to meters (m) for calculations.
						</li>
						<li>
							The frequency (\(\nu\)) is calculated using the formula: \(\nu =
							\dfrac{c}{\lambda}\).
						</li>
						<li>
							The wave number (\(\tilde{\nu}\)) is calculated using the formula:
							\(\tilde{\nu} = \dfrac{1}{\lambda}\).
						</li>
						<li>
							Radiowaves have the longest wavelengths in the electromagnetic
							spectrum, ranging from 1 mm to 100 km.
						</li>
						<li>
							To find the fraction of an atom that is occupied by the nucleus,
							compare their volumes using the formula for the volume of a
							sphere: \(\dfrac{4}{3} \pi r^3\).
						</li>
						<li>
							Wavelength (\(\lambda\)) can be converted from angstroms (Å) to
							meters (m) by multiplying by \(10^{-10}\).
						</li>
						<li>
							The energy of a photon (\(E_{\text{photon}}\)) is calculated using
							the formula \(E_{\text{photon}} = \dfrac{hc}{\lambda}\).
						</li>
						<li>
							The photoelectric equation is \(E_{\text{photon}} = \text{Work
							function} + \text{Kinetic energy}\).
						</li>
						<li>
							The number of photons (\(N\)) can be calculated by dividing the
							total energy by the energy of one photon: \(N = \dfrac{\text{Total
							Energy}}{\text{Energy per photon}}\).
						</li>
						<li>
							To calculate the number of photons emitted, use the formula for
							the energy of a photon: \(E_{\text{photon}} =
							\dfrac{hc}{\lambda}\) and then calculate the total number of
							photons emitted based on the total energy emitted by the light
							source.
						</li>
						<li>
							The threshold frequency (\(\nu_0\)) for a metal in a photoelectric
							experiment can be calculated using the formula \(h\nu_0 =
							E_{\text{photon}} - \text{Kinetic energy}\).
