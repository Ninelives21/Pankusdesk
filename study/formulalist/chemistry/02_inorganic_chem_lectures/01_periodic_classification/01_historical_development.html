			<ol class="inner-list">
				<li>
					The German chemist, Johann Dobereiner in 1829 he noted a similarity
					among the physical and chemical properties of several groups of three
					elements (Triads). In each case, he noticed that the middle element of
					each of the Triads had an atomic weight about half way between the
					atomic weights of the other two.<br />

					/>
				</li>
				<li>
					Also the properties of the middle element were in between those of the
					other two members.
				</li>
				<li>
					The model failed as all the known elements could not be fixed in
					Triads. Also, in the same group too, law was not always obeyed.
				</li>
				<li>
					John Alexander Newlands in 1865 profounded the Law of Octaves. He
					arranged the elements in increasing order of their atomic weights and
					noted that every eighth element had properties similar to the first
					element. <br />
					<img
						src="../../image/screenshots/periodic_classification/newlands_octaves.png"
						style="width: 35%; height: auto; margin-right: 10px"
					/>
				</li>
				<li>
					Newlandsâ€™s Law of Octaves seemed to be true only for elements up to
					calcium. Also, with discovery of noble gases, "octave" was no longer
					valid. Also, it began to fail with the discovery of heavier elements.
				</li>

			<span class="list_title">MENDELEEV'S LAWS</span><br />
			<ol class="inner-list">
				<li>
					The Periodic Law, as we know it today owes its development to the
					Russian chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) and the German chemist,
					Lothar Meyer (1830-1895).
				</li>
				<li>
					Lothar Meyer used a graph, while Mendeleev used a periodic table.
				</li>
				<li>
					Lothar Meyer plotted atomic volume (y-axis) vs atomic weight (x-axis).
					Elements at the similar position (example at peaks) on the curve had
					similar physical and chemical properties.<br />
					<img
						src="../../image/screenshots/periodic_classification/lothar_meyer.png"
						style="width: 35%; height: auto; margin-right: 10px"
					/>
				</li>
				<li>
					Mendeleev is also known as the "father of the periodic table of the
					chemical elements"
				</li>
				<li>
					Mendeleev's Periodic law: The properties of the elements are a
					periodic function of their atomic weights
				</li>
				<li>Mendeleev's famous Periodic Table was published in 1905</li>
				<li>He wrote a book called "Principles of Chemistry"</li>
				<li>The 101st elements is named after him -> "Mendelevium"</li>
				<li>
					At the time. he proposed periodic table of elements, the structure of
					atom was unknown. Even noble gases were not known.
				</li>
				<li>
					Merits of Mendeleev's periodic table:<br />
					<ul>
						<li>All 63 elements were arranged</li>
						<li>
							He proposed that "Periodic property is proportional to Atomic
							Weight"
						</li>
						<li>He left gaps for undiscovered elements.</li>
						<li>He even predicted properties of undiscovered elements.</li>
						<li>
							He left the gap under aluminium and a gap under silicon, and
							called these elements "Eka-Aluminium" and "Eka-Silicon". Mendeleev
							predicted not only the existence of gallium and germanium, but
							also described some of their general physical properties. These
							elements were discovered later.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Demerits of Mendeleev's periodic table:<br />
					<ul>
						<li>
							He began grouping dissimilar elements -> Na,K,Rb were placed with
							Ca and Ag
						</li>
						<li>Separated similar elements like Pt and Au</li>
						<li>
							He clubbed Isotopes whereas according to his rule, they have
							increasing atomic weights, and so should have been separate.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
