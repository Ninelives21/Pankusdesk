					<p>
						The orthocenter of a triangle is the point where all three of the
						triangle's altitudes intersect. An altitude of a triangle is a
						perpendicular segment from a vertex to the line containing the
						opposite side. The orthocenter can lie inside the triangle, outside
						the triangle, or at the vertex of a right triangle, depending on the
						type of triangle:
						<br /><br />
						<strong>Acute Triangle</strong>: The orthocenter lies inside the
						triangle.
						<br />
						<strong>Right Triangle</strong>: The orthocenter is located at the
						vertex of the right angle.
						<br />
						<strong>Obtuse Triangle</strong>: The orthocenter is outside the
						triangle.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					If a line makes an angle of \( \theta \) with the direction of the
					x-axis, then \( \tan \theta \) is called the slope. Generally, the
					slope is represented by \( m \).
					<br />
					\[ m = \tan \theta \text{, where} 0^\circ \leq \theta \leq 180^\circ
					\]

					<br />
					\[ \tan \theta = \dfrac{BC}{AC} = \dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]
				</li>

				<li>
					If two lines (not parallel to each other) are perpendicular to each
					other, then the product of their slopes is -1.

					<p>
						<strong>Proof:</strong> Slope of \( L_1 = m_1 = \tan \theta \)
						<br />
						Inclination of \( L_2 = 90^\circ + \theta \)
						<br />
						Slope of \( L_2 = m_2 = \tan (90^\circ + \theta) = -\cot \theta \)
						<br />
						\( m_1 m_2 = \tan \theta (-\cot \theta) = -1 \)

					<p>
						The circumcenter of a triangle is the point where the perpendicular
						bisectors of the sides of the triangle intersect. It is equidistant
						from all three vertices of the triangle, meaning it is the center of
						the circle that can be circumscribed around the triangle. This
						circle is called the circumcircle, and its radius is known as the
						circumradius. The circumcenter can lie inside, outside, or on the
						triangle, depending on whether the triangle is acute, obtuse, or
						right-angled, respectively. "S" is the circumcenter in the above
						figure.

					<div>
						<p>
							The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors

						The excenter of a triangle is the point where the internal bisector

						intersect. It is the center of the excircle, which is a circle
						tangent to one side of the triangle and the extensions of the other

						The nine-point circle of a triangle, also known as the Euler circle,
						is a circle that passes through nine significant concurrent points
						in the triangle. These points include the midpoints of the three
						sides, the feet of the three altitudes, and the midpoints of the
						segments connecting the orthocenter to the triangle's vertices.
						<br /><br />
						The center of the nine-point circle is the midpoint between the
						orthocenter and the circumcenter of the triangle. The center of the
						nine-point circle is called the nine-point center and is denoted by
						N. The radius of the nine-point circle is 1/2 of the circumradius.
