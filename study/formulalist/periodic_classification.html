							The German chemist, Johann Dobereiner in 1829 he noted a
							similarity among the physical and chemical properties of several
							groups of three elements (Triads). In each case, he noticed that
							the middle element of each of the Triads had an atomic weight
							about half way between the atomic weights of the other two.<br />

							/>
						</li>
						<li>
							Also the properties of the middle element were in between those of
							the other two members.
						</li>
						<li>
							The model failed as all the known elements could not be fixed in
							Triads. Also, in the same group too, law was not always obeyed.
						</li>
						<li>
							John Alexander Newlands in 1865 profounded the Law of Octaves. He
							arranged the elements in increasing order of their atomic weights
							and noted that every eighth element had properties similar to the
							first element. <br />

						</li>
						<li>
							Newlandsâ€™s Law of Octaves seemed to be true only for elements up
							to calcium. Also, with discovery of noble gases, "octave" was no
							longer valid. Also, it began to fail with the discovery of heavier
							elements.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Periodic Law, as we know it today owes its development to the
							Russian chemist, Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) and the German
							chemist, Lothar Meyer (1830-1895).
						</li>
						<li>
							Lothar Meyer used a graph, while Mendeleev used a periodic table.

						<li>
							The periodic law states that : properties of the elements are a
							periodic function of their atomic weights.
						</li>
						<li>
							Periodicity is the repitition of properties after a fixed interval
							of elements.
						</li>
						<li>
							Periodicity is also the gradual increase in the properties for
							each successive element.
