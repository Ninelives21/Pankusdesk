						<li>
							The mass of a single electron is approximately \(9.109 \times
							10^{-31}\) kg.
						</li>
						<li>
							Avogadro's number, which is the number of particles in one mole of
							a substance, is approximately \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\).
						</li>
						<li>Isoneutronic nuclides have the same number of neutrons.</li>
						<li>
							The speed of light (\(c\)) is \(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\).
						</li>
						<li>
							The wavelength (\(\lambda\)) is often given in nanometers (nm) and
							must be converted to meters (m) for calculations.
						</li>
						<li>
							The frequency (\(\nu\)) is calculated using the formula: \(\nu =
							\dfrac{c}{\lambda}\).
						</li>
						<li>
							The wave number (\(\tilde{\nu}\)) is calculated using the formula:
							\(\tilde{\nu} = \dfrac{1}{\lambda}\).
						</li>
						<li>
							Radiowaves have the longest wavelengths in the electromagnetic
							spectrum, ranging from 1 mm to 100 km.
						</li>
						<li>
							To find the fraction of an atom that is occupied by the nucleus,
							compare their volumes using the formula for the volume of a
							sphere: \(\dfrac{4}{3} \pi r^3\).
						</li>
						<li>Planck's constant (\(h\)) is \(6.626 \times 10^{-34}\) JÂ·s.</li>
						<li>
							Wavelength (\(\lambda\)) can be converted from angstroms
							(\(\mathring{A}\)) to meters (m) by multiplying by \(10^{-10}\).
						</li>
						<li>
							The energy of a photon (\(E_{\text{photon}}\)) is calculated using
							the formula \(E_{\text{photon}} = \dfrac{hc}{\lambda}\).
