					<b>Significant digits</b> are the meaningful digits in a number,
					including all known digits plus one estimated digit, indicating the
					precision of a measurement.<br /><br />

					<ol class="inner-list">
						<li>
							All non-zero digits are significant. For example in 285 cm, there
							are three significant figures and in 0.25 mL, there are two
							significant figures.
						</li>
						<li>
							Zeros preceding to first non-zero digit are not significant. Such
							zero indicates the position of decimal point. Thus, 0.03 has one
							significant figure and 0.0052 has two significant figures.
						</li>
						<li>
							Zeros between two non-zero digits are significant. Thus, 2.005 has
							four significant figures.
						</li>
						<li>
							Zeros at the end or right of a number are significant, provided
							they are on the right side of the decimal point. For example,
							\(0.200 \, \text{g}\) has three significant figures. But, if
							otherwise, the terminal zeros are not significant if there is no
							decimal point. For example, 100 has only one significant figure,
							but 100.0 has four significant figures. Such numbers are better
							represented in scientific notation. We can express the number 100
							as \(1 \times 10^2\) for one significant figure, \(1.0 \times
							10^2\) for two significant figures, and \(1.00 \times 10^2\) for
							three significant figures.
						</li>
						<li>
							Counting the numbers of objects, for example, 2 balls or 20 eggs,
							have infinite significant figures as these are exact numbers and
							can be represented by writing an infinite number of zeros after
							placing a decimal, i.e., 2 = 2.000000 or 20 = 20.000000.
						</li>
						<li>
							All constants (like Avogadro's Number, or Planck's constant or
							refractive index of a medium etc or ) also have infinite
							significant figures as these are <i>"defined"</i> values.

							One <b>atomic mass unit</b> is defined as a mass exactly equal to

						</li>
						<li>
							Mass of an atom of hydrogen \[ = 1.6736 \times 10^{-24} \,

							\, \text{g}} \] \[ = 1.0078 \, \text{amu} \] \[ = 1.0080 \,
							\text{amu} \] Similarly, the mass of oxygen-16 (\(^{16}\text{O}\))
							atom would be 15.995 amu.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Average Atomic Mass</b><br />Many naturally occurring elements
							exist as more than one isotope. When we take into account the
							existence of these isotopes and their relative abundance (per cent
							occurrence), the average atomic mass of that element can be
							computed.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Formula mass</b><br />
							Used for ionic compounds, which contain metals and non-metals.
							It's the sum of the atomic masses of the ions in the compound's
							simplest formula. Formula mass is a more general term and can
							refer to all compounds.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Molecular mass</b><br />
							Used for covalent compounds, which contain only non-metals. It's
							the sum of the atomic masses of the atoms in a molecule's actual
							formula. Molecular mass is also used to identify unknown chemicals

							In order to determine this number precisely, the mass of a

							The amount of substance, symbol \(n\), of a system is a measure of

						<b>Empirical vs Molecular Formula</b>
						<li>
							An empirical formula represents the simplest whole number ratio of
							various atoms present in a compound, whereas, the molecular
							formula shows the exact number of different types of atoms present
							in a molecule of a compound.
						</li>
						<li>
							<ol>
								A compound contains 4.07% hydrogen, 24.27% carbon and 71.65%
								chlorine. Its molar mass is 98.96 g. What are its empirical and
								molecular formulas?<br /><br />

								<li>
									Step 1. Conversion of mass per cent to grams Since we are
									having mass per cent, it is convenient to use 100 g of the
									compound as the starting material. Thus, in the 100 g sample
									of the above compound, 4.07g hydrogen, 24.27g carbon and
									71.65g chlorine are present.
								</li>
								<li>
									Step 2. Convert into number moles of each element<br />
									Divide the masses obtained above by respective atomic masses
									of various elements. This gives the number of moles of
									constituent elements in the compound<br />
									Moles of hydrogen \[ = \dfrac{4.07 \, \text{g}}{1.008 \,
									\text{g}} = 4.04 \]<br />
									Moles of carbon \[ = \dfrac{24.27 \, \text{g}}{12.01 \,
									\text{g}} = 2.021 \]<br />
									Moles of chlorine \[ = \dfrac{71.65 \, \text{g}}{35.453 \,
									\text{g}} = 2.021 \]
								</li>
								<li>
									Step 3. Divide each of the mole values obtained above by the
									smallest number amongst them<br />
									Since 2.021 is smallest value, division by it gives a ratio of
									2:1:1 for H:C:Cl.<br />
									In case the ratios are not whole numbers then they may be
									converted into whole number by multiplying by the suitable
									coefficient.
								</li>
								<li>
									Step 4. Write down the empirical formula by mentioning the
									numbers after writing the symbols of respective elements<br />
									\( \text{CH}_2\text{Cl} \) is, thus, the empirical formula of
									the above compound.
								</li>
								<li>
									Step 5. Writing molecular formula<br />
									(a) Determine empirical formula mass by adding the atomic
									masses of various atoms present in the empirical formula. For
									\( \text{CH}_2\text{Cl} \), empirical formula mass is \( 12.01
									+ (2 \times 1.008) + 35.453 = 49.48 \, \text{g} \)
								</li>
								<li>
									(b) Divide Molar mass by empirical formula mass<br />
									\[ \dfrac{\text{Molar mass}}{\text{Empirical formula mass}} =
									\dfrac{98.96 \, \text{g}}{49.48 \, \text{g}} = 2 = (n) \]
								</li>
								<li>
									(c) Multiply empirical formula by \( n \) obtained above to
									get the molecular formula<br />
									Empirical formula = \( \text{CH}_2\text{Cl} \), \( n = 2 \).
									Hence molecular formula is \( \text{C}_2\text{H}_4\text{Cl}_2
									\).
