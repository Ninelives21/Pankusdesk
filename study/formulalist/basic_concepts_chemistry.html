				<li>
					<b>Significant digits</b> are the meaningful digits in a number,
					including all known digits plus one estimated digit, indicating the
					precision of a measurement.<br /><br />

					<ol class="inner-list">
						<li>
							All non-zero digits are significant. For example in 285 cm, there
							are three significant figures and in 0.25 mL, there are two
							significant figures.
						</li>
						<li>
							Zeros preceding to first non-zero digit are not significant. Such
							zero indicates the position of decimal point. Thus, 0.03 has one
							significant figure and 0.0052 has two significant figures.
						</li>
						<li>
							Zeros between two non-zero digits are significant. Thus, 2.005 has
							four significant figures.
						</li>
						<li>
							Zeros at the end or right of a number are significant, provided
							they are on the right side of the decimal point. For example,
							\(0.200 \, \text{g}\) has three significant figures. But, if
							otherwise, the terminal zeros are not significant if there is no
							decimal point. For example, 100 has only one significant figure,
							but 100.0 has four significant figures. Such numbers are better
							represented in scientific notation. We can express the number 100
							as \(1 \times 10^2\) for one significant figure, \(1.0 \times
							10^2\) for two significant figures, and \(1.00 \times 10^2\) for
							three significant figures.
						</li>
						<li>
							Counting the numbers of objects, for example, 2 balls or 20 eggs,
							have infinite significant figures as these are exact numbers and
							can be represented by writing an infinite number of zeros after
							placing a decimal, i.e., 2 = 2.000000 or 20 = 20.000000.
						</li>
						<li>
							All constants (like Avogadro's Number, or Planck's constant or
							refractive index of a medium etc or ) also have infinite
							significant figures as these are <i>"defined"</i> values.
						</li>

						Dalton's Atomic theory<br /><br />
						<li>Matter consists of indivisible atoms.</li>
						<li>
							All atoms of a given element have identical properties, including
							identical mass. Atoms of different elements differ in mass.
						</li>
						<li>
							Compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine in a
							fixed ratio.
						</li>
						<li>
							Chemical reactions involve reorganisation of atoms. These are
							neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.
