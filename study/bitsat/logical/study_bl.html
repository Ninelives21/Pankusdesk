			<h2>BITSAT LOGICAL REASONING</h2>
			<div class="accordion list-indent">
				<p>
					The test is given to the candidates to judge their power of reasoning
					spread in verbal and nonverbal areas. The candidates should be able to
					think logically so that they perceive the data accurately, understand
					the relationships correctly, figure out the missing numbers or words,
					and apply rules in novel contexts. These indicators are measured
					through performance on such tasks as detecting missing links,
					following directions, classifying words, establishing sequences, and
					completing analogies.
